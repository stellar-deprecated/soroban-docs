:::note
The `requestAirdrop` method is still a work-in-progress.
:::

Used outside pubnet to request some lumens from friendbot for a particular account.

:::note
Maybe we could replace this with a 'friendbotUrl' field in `getNetwork` method?
:::

## Parameters

- `<account>` - Account pubkey to fund

## Returns

- `<object>`
  - `transactionId`: `<hash>` - Transaction id of the transfer as a hex-encoded string.

## Errors

- If this is pubnet (or friendbot is otherwise unavailable).
