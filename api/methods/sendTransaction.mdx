Submit a real transaction to the Stellar network. This is the only way to make changes "on-chain".

Unlike Horizon, this does not wait for transaction completion. It simply validates and enqueues the transaction. Clients should call getTransaction to learn about transaction success/failure.

This supports all transactions, not only smart contract-related transactions.

## Parameters

- `<xdr.TransactionEnvelope>` - The signed transaction to broadcast (serialized in base64)

## Returns

- `<object>`
  - `hash`: `<hash>` The transaction hash (in an hex-encoded string).
  - `status`: `<status>` - The current status of the transaction by hash, one of:
    - `PENDING` - The transaction has been accepted by stellar-core.
    - `DUPLICATE` - The transaction has already been submitted to stellar-core.
    - `TRY_AGAIN_LATER` - The transaction was not included in the previous 4 ledgers and is banned from the next few ledgers.
    - `ERROR` - An error occurred from submitting the transaction to stellar-core.
  - `latestLedger`: `<string>` - The latest ledger known to Soroban-RPC at the time it handled the `sendTransaction()` request.
  - `latestLedgerCloseTime`: `<string>` - The unix timestamp of the close time of the latest ledger known to Soroban-RPC at the time it handled the `sendTransaction()` request.
  - `errorResultXdr`: `<xdr.TransactionResult>` -  (optional) If the transaction status is `ERROR`, this will be a base64 encoded string of the raw TransactionResult XDR struct containing details on why stellar-core rejected the transaction.
