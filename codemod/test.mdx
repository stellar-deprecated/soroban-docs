### More_info_url

Once the transaction is completed on the Stellar network, the transaction’s status will update from "pending_stellar" to "completed."

This will open the prompt with a select\<\>options input field rather than a text input field.

We’re not really making full use of [ Capacitor ][2], but it is an amazing service so be sure and check it out! For now we just need it to make storing and retrieving our data a bit more stable.

To find out everything you'd ever want to know about stellar.toml files, check out [SEP-1], which is the complete stellar.toml specification.

And here's [AnchorUSD]'s[3].

_(It may be strange that A never holds any tokens of its custom asset, but that's exactly how issuing works: you create value where there used to be none. Sending an asset to its issuing account is *equivalent* to burning it, and auditing the total amount of an asset in existence is one of the benefits of properly distributing an asset via a [distribution account](../issuing-assets/how-to-issue-an-asset.mdx#why-have-separate-accounts-for-issuing-and-distribution), which we avoid doing here for example brevity.)_

For example, if you're _selling_ 100 XLM in exchange for 40 USD, you would specify the price as `{40, 100}`, which would be the equivalent of 2.5 XLM for 1 USD (or \$.40 per XLM) (_nice profit_).

It’s a lot of code, but keep in mind this is everything we need to completely interoperate with financial infrastructure foreign to the Stellar ecosystem, which is a big ask and in ~130 lines of code. It’s a modern day miracle!

1. The wallet prompts the user to add the asset/create the trustline.
1. Finally, the anchor sends the deposit funds to the user’s Stellar account.

Note: the testnet is reset every three months, so when building on it, make sure you have a plan to recreate necessary accounts and other data. For more info, check out the [best practices for using the testnet](../../glossary/testnet.mdx#best-practices-for-using-testnet).

## Result Codes

Fee-bump transactions share result codes with regular transactions. They're listed in a table below. Error reference for operations can be found in [List of Operations](../start/list-of-operations.mdx) doc.

| Result | Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FEE_BUMP_INNER_SUCCESS | 1 | The inner transaction contained in the fee bump succeeded. |
| SUCCESS | 0 | All operations contained in the transaction succeeded. |
| FAILED | -1 | One of the operations failed (check [List of operations](../start/list-of-operations.mdx) for errors). |
| TOO_EARLY | -2 | Ledger `closeTime` before `minTime` value in the transaction. |
| TOO_LATE | -3 | Ledger `closeTime` after `maxTime` value in the transaction. |
| MISSING_OPERATION | -4 | No operation was specified. |
| BAD_SEQ | -5 | Sequence number does not match source account. |
| BAD_AUTH | -6 | Too few valid signatures / wrong network. |
| INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE | -7 | Fee would bring account below [minimum reserve](./minimum-balance.mdx). |
| NO_ACCOUNT | -8 | Source account not found. |
| INSUFFICIENT_FEE | -9 | [Fee](./fees.mdx) is too small. |
| BAD_AUTH_EXTRA | -10 | Unused signatures attached to transaction. |
| INTERNAL_ERROR | -11 | An unknown error occured. |
| NOT_SUPPORTED | -12 | The transaction type is not supported |
| FEE_BUMP_INNER_FAILED | -13 | The fee bump inner transaction failed. See [Fee Bumps](./fee-bumps.mdx) for more info. |

Each slot contains the oldest ledger that is mod of either 50 5000 50000 or 500000 depending on index skipList[0] mod(50), skipList[1] mod(5000), etc.

OperationID is a union with one possible type (ENVELOPE_TYPE_OP_ID).

ClaimableBalanceID is a union with one possible type (CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_ID_TYPE_V0).

- **Alphanumeric 12-character maximum**: Any characters from the set [a-z]\[A-Z\][0-9] are allowed. The code can be any number of characters from 5 to 12, but the trailing characters must all be empty.

Regardless of whether you are running live ingestion or building up historical data, you may occasionally need to _re_ingest ledgers anew (for example on certain upgrades of Horizon). For this, you use the same command as above.

_(Though Horizon can run on Windows, *building* directly on Windows is not supported.)_

If any of the above steps don't work or you are otherwise prevented from correctly setting up Horizon, please join our community and let us know. Either post a question at [our Stack Exchange](https://stellar.stackexchange.com/) or chat with us on [Keybase in #dev_discussion](https://keybase.io/team/stellar.public) to ask for help.

- **print-xdr `<FILE-NAME>`**: Pretty-print a binary file containing an XDR object. If FILE-NAME is "-", the XDR object is read from standard input.<br/> Option --filetype [auto|ledgerheader|meta|result|resultpair|tx|txfee]\*\* controls type used for printing (default: auto).<br/> Option --base64 alters the behavior to work on base64-encoded XDR rather than raw XDR.

- **dropcursor**  
  `dropcursor?id=ID`<br/> Deletes the tracking cursor identified by `id`. See `setcursor` for more information.

- **droppeer** `droppeer?node=NODE_ID[&ban=D]`<br/> Drops peer identified by NODE_ID, when D is 1 the peer is also banned.

- **info** Returns information about the server in JSON format (sync state, connected peers, etc).

- **ll**  
  `ll?level=L[&partition=P]`<br/> Adjust the log level for partition P where P is one of Bucket, Database, Fs, Herder, History, Ledger, Overlay, Process, SCP, Tx (or all if no partition is specified). Level is one of FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, VERBOSE, TRACE.

- **peers?[&fullkeys=true]** Returns the list of known peers in JSON format. If `fullkeys` is set, outputs unshortened public keys.

Rolling your own crypto is a bad idea. Always use tried and tested libraries. A good example is [NaCl](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaCl_(software)>).
