# Crowdfund Dapp Challenge

This challenge will walk you through the process of building a crowdfunding Dapp on Stellar. You will learn how to deploy smart contracts to the Stellar network, and how to interact with them through a web frontend.

## Checkpoint 0: üì¶ Install üìö

Start by installing the required dependencies.

Required:

- `soroban-cli v0.8.0`: [Download Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli)
- `docker` (both Standalone and Futurenet backends require it): [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- `Node` v17: [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Freighter Wallet`: [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app/)

Clone the soroban example dapp repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-example-dapp
cd soroban-example-dapp
```

Install the project dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, build the soroban-preview docker image:

```sh
make build-docker
```

Building the docker image lets you avoid installing the specific version of soroban-cli if desired.

## Checkpoint 1: üöÄ Launch Backend üåê

Open your Docker Desktop app and make sure it is running. Then run the following command to start the backend:

```sh
./quickstart.sh standalone
```

and wait for it to start.

## Checkpoint 2: üé¨ Deploy Smart Contracts

Now that the backend environment is set up, we need to deploy our smart contracts to the Stellar network.

In another terminal, load the contracts and initialize them.

Use your own local soroban-cli:

```sh
./initialize.sh standalone
```

Or run it inside the soroban-preview docker container:

```sh
docker exec soroban-preview ./initialize.sh standalone
```

If the command ran successfully, it will return a Contract ID. Take note of this ID as you will need it in the next steps.

## Checkpoint 4: ü§ù Connect the Frontend to the Backend

First, start the development server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Now open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000. You should be able to see the frontend of your Dapp.

Now that we have the frontend running, it's time to connect it with our smart contracts.

Add the Futurenet custom network in Freighter (Note, the out-of-the-box "Future Net" network in Freighter will not work with a local quickstart container, so we need to add our own):

- Name: `Standalone`
- URL: `http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc`
- Passphrase: `Standalone Network ; February 2017`
- Allow HTTP connection: `Enabled`
- Switch to this network: `Enabled`

Then, add some Standalone network lumens to your Freighter wallet by doing the following:

- Copy the address for your freighter wallet.
- Visit `http://localhost:8000/friendbot?addr=<your_address>`

## Checkpoint 6: üè¶ Mint Tokens for the Crowdfunding Campaign

Open the Dapp frontend and click on the "Mint 100 EXT" button.

<img src={mintToken} width="40%" />

You should see a popup from Freighter asking you to sign the transaction. Click on "Approve" and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

<img src={approveTokenMint} width="40%" />

You should see an updated balance in the pledge component.

<img src={updatedBalance} width="40%" />

## Checkpoint 7: üí∞ Fund the Crowdfunding Campaign

Now that we have our wallet set up, let's fund the crowdfunding campaign.

Open the frontend and click on the "Back this project" button. You should see a popup from Freighter asking you to sign the transaction.

<img src={back100} width="40%" />

Click on "Approve" and wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

Once the transaction is confirmed, you should see a success message.

<img src={success} width="40%" />

You should see an updated balance in and amount you have pledged in the pledge component.

<img src={backedResult} width="40%" />

## Checkpoint 8: üö¢ Ship it! üöÅ

Now that our Dapp is fully functional locally, let's prepare it for deployment on futurenet.

If you are running docker, now is a good time to stop the stellar and soroban preview containers.

```sh
docker stop stellar soroban-preview
```

First, edit the `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` value in the `initialize.sh` script to use the Soroban RPC endoint on futurenet:

```sh
# initialize.sh
SOROBAN_RPC_URL="https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org"
```

Then, run the following command to initialize the contracts on futurenet:

```sh
./initialize.sh futurenet
```

Then run the dev server again:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Now open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000. You should be able to see the frontend of your Dapp.

Next, add the [Soroban RPC](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/run-rpc) network in Freighter:

- Name: `Soroban Futurenet`
- URL: `https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org`
- Passphrase: `Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022`
- Allow HTTP connection: `Enabled`
- Switch to this network: `Enabled`

Reload the page and you should see your pledge amount and balance updated.

Now, you can upload your app to a hosting platform of your choice. You could use platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or even an AWS S3 bucket.

For this example, we will need to edit the `package.json` file to edit the following lines:

```js
  "engines": {
    "node": "17",
    "npm": "8"
  }
```

And update our node engine, and npm version to 18 and 9 respectively:

```js
  "engines": {
    "node": "18",
    "npm": "9"
  }
```

Next we will use the Vercel cli to complete our deployment

> Note: If you dont already have a [Vercel account], you will need to create one and link it to your github account.

[Vercel account]: https://vercel.com/login

First install the Vercel cli:

```sh
npm i global vercel
```

Then run the following command to deploy your app:

```sh
npx vercel
```

Then continue through the prompts(you will not need to modify any settings) until you reach the completion prompt similar to the following:

```sh
Vercel CLI 30.1.1
üîó  Linked to julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp (created .vercel)
üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp/C1YZVQSqh6WcyR1uvxz8q2tW1tjD [2s]
‚úÖ  Production: https://soroban-example-dapp-rho.vercel.app [42s]
```

You can now visit the preview link to see your deployed app! üéâ

<img src={deployedDApp} width="90%" />

You will need to add some Futurenet network lumens to your Freighter wallet to interact with the deployed dApp. Visit [https://laboratory.stellar.org/#create-account](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#create-account), and follow the instructions to create your freighter account on Futurenet.

## Checkpoint 9: ‚úÖ Complete the Challenge!

Submit your public url to the challenge form.

<ParentChallengeForm courseId={0} />

## Checkpoint 10: üí™ Flex!

Share your public url with a friend and ask them to contribute to the crowdfunding campaign

## ‚öîÔ∏è Side Quests

üåê Explore [Stellar Laboratory] to inspect your account assets on the Stellar network.

You should see something like this:

```json
  "balances": [
    {
      "balance": "100.0000000",
      "limit": "922337203685.4775807",
      "buying_liabilities": "0.0000000",
      "selling_liabilities": "0.0000000",
      "last_modified_ledger": 148108,
      "is_authorized": true,
      "is_authorized_to_maintain_liabilities": true,
      "asset_type": "credit_alphanum4",
      "asset_code": "EXT",
      "asset_issuer": "GBUGENT4FK4Y6FZNZEEGVZJLCHKNES23FRVOPPOI62RUF4WRSNOTSZV4"
    },
  ]
```
