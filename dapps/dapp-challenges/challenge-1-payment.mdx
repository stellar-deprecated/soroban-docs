This challenge will guide you through the process of setting up, customizing, and deploying a Soroban Payment dapp, a blockchain-powered payment application designed to work with the Freighter wallet. Payment dapps are powerful because they offer users equitable and accessible means to send and receive payments. Transactions via a payment dapp are peer-to-peer, which means that no central authority, third-party, or bank oversees or controls the payment. This decentralization reduces payment fees, which are comparatively minimal on a blockchain, and transaction time, which is, via a payment dapp, almost instantaneous. What's more, the wallet integration in a payment dapp, like Freighter in this case, means that anyone with a smartphone and the wallet installed can use the payment dapp, no matter where they are in the world. 

## Checkpoint 0: üì¶ Install Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system. You'll also want to be sure you have the most updated versions of Rust and Soroban installed.

- `Node` (>=16.14.0 < 17.0.0): [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Yarn` (v1.22.5 or newer): [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- `Freighter Wallet`: [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app/)

Node and Yarn are package managers that let you... during the dapp development process. Freighter is the wallet you will integrate into your payment dapp.

## Checkpoint 1: üöÄ Clone the Repository

Clone and set up the Soroban Dapps Challenge repository, which contains the Soroban Payment Dapp files. Then run yarn to...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-dapps-challenge.git
cd soroban-dapps-challenge
git checkout payment
yarn
```

## Checkpoint 2: üé¨ Deploy Smart Contracts

For this step you will need to clone and deploy the Soroban token smart contract from the Soroban Examples repository. This Soroban token smart contract, broken into several smaller modules (as is the custom for complex smart contracts like this one), enables you to... If you are curious about the specific functionality contained in these modules, feel free to take a look at their code.

The Soroban token is a custom token that will be used to facilitate payments in the Payment Dapp. Tokens are essentially programmable assets on a blockchain, and smart contracts provide the automation and rules for these tokens. They allow for predefined conditions and actions related to the tokens, such as issuance, transfer, and more complex functions, ensuring the execution of these operations without the need for intermediaries. In the case of this Payment Dapp, you will use the Soroban token to initialize and mint "Demo Token" assets, or DT, that you can then use to make payments via the Payment Dapp.

In a new terminal window, follow the steps below to build and deploy the token smart contract:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples.git
cd soroban-examples/token
make
```

This will build the smart contracts and put them in the `token/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` directory.

Next, you will need to deploy the token smart contract to Futurenet. In order to deploy to future, you will need a Stellar account keypair (a public key and its corresponding secret key). Keep in mind that Freighter, where you can create and view your account's public key, intentionally does not allow you or any application to access your secret key. It's recommended therefore to generate a new Futurenet keypair using [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=futurenet), fund the account, and then import the keypair's public key into your Freighter wallet.

Once you have done this and are ready to deploy the token smart contract to Futurenet, open a terminal in the `soroban-examples/token` directory and follow the steps below:

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_token_contract.wasm \
    --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY> \
    --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022'
```

Deploying the token contract to Futurenet will return a contract ID that you will need to use in the next step to invoke the token smart contract and initialize the Soroban token as "Demo Token":

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
    --id <TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID> \
    --source-account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY> \
    --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' \
    -- initialize \
    --admin <ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY> \
    --decimal 7 \
    --name "Demo Token" \
    --symbol "DT"
```

Lets take a look at what is happening here:

- admin: This is the public key of the administrator account and corresponds to the secret key you used to deploy the contract in the previous step. It is the "master" account that has control over the token contract.

- decimal: This decimal precision value is set to 7. This value indicates that your token will have 7 decimal places, providing fine-grained control and flexibility in transactions.

- name: This value is set to "Demo Token," the name of your token written as a string.

- symbol: Your token symbol is a short string that represents your token, in this case, "DT."

Next, you will need to mint some tokens to your sender's account (the administrator account you used to deploy the contract and initialize the token above). To do this, run the following command:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
    --id <TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID> \
    --source-account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY> \
    --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
    --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' \
    -- mint \
    --to <USER_PUBLIC_KEY> \
    --amount 1000000000
```

## Checkpoint 3: üñ•Ô∏è Launch the Frontend

In this checkpoint, you will make sure that the frontend of the Payment Dapp successfully communicates with the backend, allowing transactions to be created, signed, and submitted to the network.

Open a terminal in the `soroban-dapps-challenge` directory and run the following command to launch the frontend of your dapp:

```bash
yarn start
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
$ webpack-dev-server --config config/webpack.dev.js
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:9000/
...
```

Now open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9000/`. You should see the Payment Dapp running in your browser.

## Checkpoint 5: üö¢ Ship it! üöÅ

You can upload your dapp to a hosting platform of your choice. You could use platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or even an AWS S3 bucket.

For this example, we will use the Vercel cli to complete your deployment

> Note: If you dont already have a [Vercel account], you will need to create one and link it to your GitHub account.

[Vercel account]: https://vercel.com/login

First install the Vercel cli:

```bash
npm i --global vercel
```

Then run the following command to deploy your app:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Then continue through the prompts until you see the following output:

```bash
No framework detected. Default Project Settings:
- Build Command: 'npm run vercel-build' or 'npm run build'
- Development Command: None
- Install Command: 'yarn install', 'pnpm install', or 'npm install'
- Output Directory: 'public' if it exists, or '.'
```

Select `y` to continue, and then select `build` as the output directory.

```bash
? Want to modify these settings? [y/N] y
? Which settings would you like to overwrite (select multiple)? Output Directory
? Output Directory? build
```

Once the deployment is complete, you should see something similar to the following output:

```bash
üîó  Linked to julian-dev28/soroban-react-payment (created .vercel)
üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/julian-dev28/soroban-react-payment/AQoFFhZf5K1ufQj57eawApPkFduf [2s]
‚úÖ  Production: https://soroban-react-payment.vercel.app [58s]
```

You can now visit the preview link to see your deployed dapp! üéâ

You will need to add some Futurenet network lumens to your Freighter wallet to interact with the deployed dapp. Visit [https://laboratory.stellar.org/#create-account](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#create-account), and follow the instructions to create your Freighter account on Futurenet.
