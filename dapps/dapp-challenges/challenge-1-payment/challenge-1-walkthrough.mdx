# Creating a Payment Dapp with Soroban

We'll be exploring an example [Soroban Payment Dapp](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-react-payment) built by the Wallet Engineering team at SDF. The dapp is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It uses the [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) wallet to connect to the Stellar network and sign transactions.

8. [Running the Example Dapp](#running-the-example-dapp)

## Prerequisites

The Payment Dapp relies on the following dependencies:

- `Node` (>=16.14.0 < 17.0.0): [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Yarn` (v1.22.5 or newer): [Download here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
- `Freighter` wallet: [Download here](https://www.freighter.app/)

## Setup

To set up the Soroban Payment Dapp, follow the steps below:

1. Install and set up the Freighter wallet.
2. Clone the Payment Dapp repository and navigate into it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-react-payment.git
cd soroban-react-payment
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

## Understanding the Frontend Code: SendPayment Component

The `SendPayment` component is a part of a Soroban Payment Dapp and is responsible for handling the creation of a payment. Let's delve into the details of this component:

### Importing Dependencies

The component starts by importing necessary libraries, components, and helper functions. These include several components from the `@stellar/design-system` library, such as `Card`, `Caption`, `Layout`, `Notification`, `Profile`, `Loader`, and helper functions from local directories, among others.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { createPortal } from "react-dom";
import {
  Card,
  Caption,
  Layout,
  Notification,
  Profile,
  Loader,
} from "@stellar/design-system";
import freighterApi from "@stellar/freighter-api";

import {
  connectNetwork,
  Networks,
  NetworkDetails,
} from "../../helpers/network";
import { ERRORS } from "../../helpers/error";
import {
  getTxBuilder,
  BASE_FEE,
  XLM_DECIMALS,
  getTokenSymbol,
  getTokenDecimals,
  getTokenBalance,
  getServer,
  submitTx,
} from "../../helpers/soroban";
...
```

### Declaring Types

Types are declared for the StepCount (which is a type representing the step of the payment process) and SendPaymentProps (the interface for the component props).

```tsx
type StepCount = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10;

interface SendPaymentProps {
  showHeader?: boolean;
}
```

### Component Definition

The `SendPayment` function is a functional component that takes props of type `SendPaymentProps`. The props include an optional `showHeader` boolean.

```tsx
export const SendPayment = (props: SendPaymentProps) => {
  ...
};
```

### Using React State

State variables are declared and initialized using the `useState` hook for various data such as the active network details, active public key, step count, connection error, token details, payment destination, send amount, fee, memo, transaction result, loading states, etc.

```tsx
// State variables
// `showHeader` determines whether the header component should be displayed.
const showHeader = props.showHeader === undefined ? true : props.showHeader;

// Active network details
const [activeNetworkDetails, setActiveNetworkDetails] = React.useState(
  {} as NetworkDetails
);

// Active public key
const [activePubKey, setActivePubKey] = React.useState(null as string | null);

// Step count in the payment flow
const [stepCount, setStepCount] = React.useState(1 as StepCount);

// Connection error
const [connectionError, setConnectionError] = React.useState(
  null as string | null
);

// Token details
// `tokenId` stores the ID of the selected token.
const [tokenId, setTokenId] = React.useState("");

// `tokenDecimals` represents the number of decimal places for the token.
const [tokenDecimals, setTokenDecimals] = React.useState(XLM_DECIMALS);

// `paymentDestination` holds the payment destination address.
const [paymentDestination, setPaymentDest] = React.useState("");

// `sendAmount` stores the amount of tokens to be sent in the payment.
const [sendAmount, setSendAmount] = React.useState("");

// `tokenSymbol` represents the symbol or ticker of the selected token.
const [tokenSymbol, setTokenSymbol] = React.useState("");

// `tokenBalance` holds the balance of the selected token.
const [tokenBalance, setTokenBalance] = React.useState("");

// `fee` represents the transaction fee to be paid.
const [fee, setFee] = React.useState(BASE_FEE);

// `memo` stores any additional message or note for the payment.
const [memo, setMemo] = React.useState("");

// `txResultXDR` holds the XDR-encoded transaction result.
const [txResultXDR, settxResultXDR] = React.useState("");

// `signedXdr` represents the signed XDR-encoded transaction.
const [signedXdr, setSignedXdr] = React.useState("");

// Loading states
// `isLoadingTokenDetails` indicates whether the token details are being loaded.
const [isLoadingTokenDetails, setTokenDetails] = React.useState(false);
// `isSubmitting` represents the loading state during transaction submission.
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = React.useState(false);
```

These state variables are used to render the appropriate UI elements and handle the payment flow within the Dapp.

## Helper Functions

Several helper functions are declared within the component:

### setToken

`setToken`: An async function that fetches token details like symbol, balance, and decimals and sets the corresponding state variables.

```tsx
async function setToken(id: string) {
  setTokenDetails(true); // 1
  setTokenId(id); // 2

  const server = getServer(activeNetworkDetails); // 3

  try {
    // 4. Transaction builder for symbol
    const txBuilderSymbol = await getTxBuilder(
      activePubKey!,
      BASE_FEE,
      server,
      activeNetworkDetails.networkPassphrase
    );

    // 5. Fetch and set symbol
    const symbol = await getTokenSymbol(id, txBuilderSymbol, server);
    setTokenSymbol(symbol);

    // 6. Transaction builder for balance
    const txBuilderBalance = await getTxBuilder(
      activePubKey!,
      BASE_FEE,
      server,
      activeNetworkDetails.networkPassphrase
    );

    // 7. Fetch and set balance
    const balance = await getTokenBalance(
      activePubKey!,
      id,
      txBuilderBalance,
      server
    );
    setTokenBalance(balance);

    // 8. Transaction builder for decimals
    const txBuilderDecimals = await getTxBuilder(
      activePubKey!,
      BASE_FEE,
      server,
      activeNetworkDetails.networkPassphrase
    );

    // 9. Fetch and set decimals
    const decimals = await getTokenDecimals(id, txBuilderDecimals, server);
    setTokenDecimals(decimals);

    // 10. Stop loading
    setTokenDetails(false);

    // 11. Success
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    setConnectionError("Unable to fetch token details."); // 12. Handle errors
    setTokenDetails(false); // 13. Stop loading even on error

    return false; // 14. Indicate failure
  }
}
```

Here's the detailed breakdown:

- It starts by setting the loading state to `true` with `setTokenDetails`.
- Then, it sets the `tokenId` state to the id passed into the function.
- It fetches server details based on the active network.
- It initializes a transaction builder to fetch the token's symbol.
- It fetches the token symbol and updates the `tokenSymbol` state.
- It initializes another transaction builder to fetch the token's balance.
- It fetches the token balance and updates the `tokenBalance` state.
- It initializes yet another transaction builder to fetch the token's decimals.
- It fetches the token decimals and updates the `tokenDecimals` state.
- After fetching all the details, it sets the loading state to `false`.
- If all the above steps are successful, it returns `true`.
- If there is any error during these steps, it logs the error, sets the error message to "Unable to fetch token details."
- Even if there's an error, it sets the loading state to `false`.
- In case of an error, it returns `false` to indicate failure.

### renderStep

`renderStep`: A function that renders different components based on the current step in the payment flow. This function uses a switch statement to determine which component to render based on the `stepCount`.

```tsx
function renderStep(step: StepCount) {
  switch (step) {
    case 8: {
      // Step 8: Render TxResult component
      const onClick = () => setStepCount(1);
      return <TxResult onClick={onClick} resultXDR={txResultXDR} />;
    }
    case 7: {
      // Step 7: Render SubmitPayment component
      const submit = async () => {
        setIsSubmitting(true);
        try {
          const server = getServer(activeNetworkDetails);
          const result = await submitTx(
            signedXdr,
            activeNetworkDetails.networkPassphrase,
            server
          );

          settxResultXDR(result);
          setIsSubmitting(false);

          setStepCount((stepCount + 1) as StepCount);
        } catch (error) {
          console.log(error);
          setIsSubmitting(false);
          setConnectionError(ERRORS.UNABLE_TO_SUBMIT_TX);
        }
      };
      return (
        <SubmitPayment
          network={activeNetworkDetails.network}
          destination={paymentDestination}
          amount={sendAmount}
          tokenSymbol={tokenSymbol}
          fee={fee}
          signedXdr={signedXdr}
          isSubmitting={isSubmitting}
          memo={memo}
          onClick={submit}
        />
      );
    }
    case 6: {
      // Step 6: Render ConfirmPayment component
      const setSignedTx = (xdr: string) => {
        setSignedXdr(xdr);
        setStepCount((stepCount + 1) as StepCount);
      };
      return (
        <ConfirmPayment
          tokenId={tokenId}
          tokenDecimals={tokenDecimals}
          pubKey={activePubKey!}
          tokenSymbol={tokenSymbol}
          onTxSign={setSignedTx}
          network={activeNetworkDetails.network}
          destination={paymentDestination}
          amount={sendAmount}
          fee={fee}
          memo={memo}
          networkDetails={activeNetworkDetails}
        />
      );
    }
    case 5: {
      // Step 5: Render Fee component
      const onClick = () => setStepCount((stepCount + 1) as StepCount);
      return (
        <Fee
          fee={fee}
          memo={memo}
          onClick={onClick}
          setFee={setFee}
          setMemo={setMemo}
        />
      );
    }
    case 4: {
      // Step 4: Render SendAmount component
      const onClick = () => setStepCount((stepCount + 1) as StepCount);
      return (
        <SendAmount
          amount={sendAmount}
          decimals={tokenDecimals}
          setAmount={setSendAmount}
          onClick={onClick}
          balance={tokenBalance}
          tokenSymbol={tokenSymbol}
        />
      );
    }
    case 3: {
      // Step 3: Render TokenInput component
      if (isLoadingTokenDetails) {
        return (
          <div className="loading">
            <Loader />
          </div>
        );
      }
      const onClick = async (value: string) => {
        const success = await setToken(value);

        if (success) {
          setStepCount((stepCount + 1) as StepCount);
        }
      };
      return <TokenInput onClick={onClick} />;
    }
    case 2: {
      // Step 2: Render PaymentDest component
      const onClick = () => setStepCount((stepCount + 1) as StepCount);
      return (
        <PaymentDest
          onClick={onClick}
          setDestination={setPaymentDest}
          destination={paymentDestination}
        />
      );
    }
    case 1:
    default: {
      // Step 1 (default): Render ConnectWallet component
      const onClick =
        activeNetworkDetails.network && connectionError === null
          ? () => setStepCount((stepCount + 1) as StepCount)
          : setConnection;
      return (
        <ConnectWallet
          network={activeNetworkDetails.network}
          connectionError={connectionError}
          onClick={onClick}
        />
      );
    }
  }
}
```

Here's the breakdown of each step:

- Step 1 (default): Renders the `ConnectWallet` component. It handles wallet connection and updates the step count if successful. If the network is supported and there are no connection errors, it updates the step count on click.
- Step 2: Renders the `PaymentDest` component. It handles the payment destination input and updates the step count on click.
- Step 3: Renders the `TokenInput` component. It handles token selection and updates the step count if successful. If loading token details, it displays a loader.
- Step 4: Renders the `SendAmount` component. It handles the amount input and updates the step count on click.
- Step 5: Renders the `Fee` component. It sets the fee and memo and updates the step count on click.
- Step 6: Renders the `ConfirmPayment` component. It sets the signed transaction and updates the step count.
- Step 7: Renders the `SubmitPayment` component. It handles the submit logic and updates the step count based on the result. If there's an error, it sets the connection error.
- Step 8: Renders the `TxResult` component and sets the onClick handler to update the step count to 1.

### setConnection

`setConnection`: An async function that establishes a connection with the Freighter wallet and sets the corresponding state variables.

```tsx
async function setConnection() {
  // Reset connection error and active public key states
  setConnectionError(null);
  setActivePubKey(null);

  // Check if Freighter wallet is connected
  const isConnected = await freighterApi.isConnected();

  // If not connected, set connection error and return
  if (!isConnected) {
    setConnectionError(ERRORS.FREIGHTER_NOT_AVAILABLE);
    return;
  }

  // Retrieve network details and public key
  const { networkDetails, pubKey } = await connectNetwork();

  // Check if the network is unsupported
  if (networkDetails.network !== Networks.Futurenet) {
    setConnectionError(ERRORS.UNSUPPORTED_NETWORK);
  }

  // Set active network details and public key
  setActiveNetworkDetails(networkDetails);
  setActivePubKey(pubKey);
}
```

Here's the breakdown of each step:

- It starts by resetting the connection error state to `null` and the active public key state to `null`.
- It then uses the `freighterApi.isConnected()` function to check if the Freighter wallet is connected. If it's not connected, it sets the connection error state to `ERRORS.FREIGHTER_NOT_AVAILABLE`, indicating that Freighter is not available for use.
- If the wallet is connected, it proceeds to retrieve the network details and public key using the `connectNetwork()` function. These details are destructured from the returned object.
- Next, it checks if the network retrieved from `networkDetails` is not equal to `Networks.Futurenet`. If it's not the supported network, it sets the connection error state to `ERRORS.UNSUPPORTED_NETWORK`.
- Finally, if the connection setup is successful, it sets the active network details state to networkDetails and the active public key state to `pubKey`. This completes the connection setup process.

## Processing Transactions

The `renderStep` function plays a crucial role in processing transactions in the payment flow. It contains the components necessary for the payment flow and handles the logic for each step. Lets take a look at the final 3 steps of the payment flow and examine how transaction processing is handled:

### Step 6: Confirming Payment

In step 6, the `ConfirmPayment` component is rendered. This component displays the confirmation details of the payment transaction, such as the token ID, decimals, sender's public key, token symbol, destination, amount, fee, memo, and network details. It provides an `onTxSign` handler that takes the signed transaction as a parameter (`xdr`) and updates the `signedXdr` state with the provided value. Additionally, the step count is incremented to proceed to the next step.

```tsx
case 6: {
  // Step 6: Render ConfirmPayment component
  const setSignedTx = (xdr: string) => {
    setSignedXdr(xdr);
    setStepCount((stepCount + 1) as StepCount);
  };
  return (
    <ConfirmPayment
      tokenId={tokenId}
      tokenDecimals={tokenDecimals}
      pubKey={activePubKey!}
      tokenSymbol={tokenSymbol}
      onTxSign={setSignedTx}
      network={activeNetworkDetails.network}
      destination={paymentDestination}
      amount={sendAmount}
      fee={fee}
      memo={memo}
      networkDetails={activeNetworkDetails}
    />
  );
}
```

Heres a breakdown of the `ConfirmPayment` component:

```tsx
export const ConfirmPayment = (props: ConfirmPaymentProps) => {
  const signWithFreighter = async () => {
    const amount = parseTokenAmount(props.amount, props.tokenDecimals);
    const server = getServer(props.networkDetails);
    const builder = await getTxBuilder(
      props.pubKey,
      props.fee,
      server,
      props.networkDetails.networkPassphrase
    );
    const xdr = await makePayment(
      props.tokenId,
      amount.toNumber(),
      props.destination,
      props.pubKey,
      props.memo,
      builder,
      server,
      props.networkDetails.networkPassphrase
    );
    const options = {
      network: props.networkDetails.network,
      networkPassphrase: props.networkDetails.networkPassphrase,
      accountToSign: props.pubKey,
    };
    const signedTx = await signTx(xdr, options);
    props.onTxSign(signedTx);
  };
};
```

The `ConfirmPayment` component handles the confirmation step in the payment process. It receives the following props:

- `tokenId`: The ID of the selected token.
- `tokenDecimals`: The number of decimal places for the token.
- `pubKey`: The public key of the sender's account.
- `tokenSymbol`: The symbol or ticker of the selected token.
- `onTxSign`: A callback function that takes the signed transaction as a parameter.

Within the component, the `signWithFreighter` function is defined. This function performs the necessary steps to sign the transaction using the Freighter wallet.

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

- Parsing the token amount: The `parseTokenAmount` function is used to convert the amount from a string representation to the appropriate numerical value based on the token's decimals.

- Setting up the server and transaction builder: The server details are obtained using the `getServer` function. The transaction builder is created using the `getTxBuilder` function, providing the necessary parameters such as the sender's public key, fee, server, and network passphrase.

- Creating the payment transaction: The `makePayment` function is called with the token ID, amount, destination address, sender's public key, memo, transaction builder, server, and network passphrase. This function generates the XDR representation of the payment transaction.

- Configuring the signing options: The options object is created, specifying the network and network passphrase, as well as the account to sign the transaction (`accountToSign`).

- Signing the transaction: The `signTx` function is used to sign the XDR transaction using the Freighter wallet. The signed transaction (`signedTx`) is obtained.

- Callback and completion: The `onTxSign` callback function provided as a prop is called with the signed transaction as the parameter, allowing the parent component to handle the signed transaction accordingly.

This process completes the confirmation step by signing the transaction using the Freighter wallet and triggering the callback to proceed to the next step in the payment flow.

### Step 7: Submitting Payment

When the step count is 7, the `SubmitPayment` component is rendered. This component handles the submission of the payment transaction. Upon clicking the submit button, the submit function is called. Within this function, the `isSubmitting` state is set to `true` to indicate that the transaction submission is in progress. The transaction is submitted by calling the `submitTx` function with the provided details such as the signed transaction (`signedXdr`), network passphrase, and server. If the submission is successful, the transaction result is stored in the `txResultXDR` state, the `isSubmitting` state is set back to false, and the step count is incremented to move to the next step. In case of an error during submission, the error is logged, the `isSubmitting` state is set to `false`, and the `connectionError` state is set to indicate that the transaction submission failed.

```tsx
case 7: {
  // Step 7: Render SubmitPayment component
  const submit = async () => {
    setIsSubmitting(true);
    try {
      const server = getServer(activeNetworkDetails);
      const result = await submitTx(
        signedXdr,
        activeNetworkDetails.networkPassphrase,
        server
      );

      settxResultXDR(result);
      setIsSubmitting(false);

      setStepCount((stepCount + 1) as StepCount);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
      setIsSubmitting(false);
      setConnectionError(ERRORS.UNABLE_TO_SUBMIT_TX);
    }
  };
  return (
    <SubmitPayment
      network={activeNetworkDetails.network}
      destination={paymentDestination}
      amount={sendAmount}
      tokenSymbol={tokenSymbol}
      fee={fee}
      signedXdr={signedXdr}
      isSubmitting={isSubmitting}
      memo={memo}
      onClick={submit}
    />
  );
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the `SubmitPayment` component:

```tsx
export const SubmitPayment = (props: SubmitPaymentProps) => (
  <>
    {/* Heading */}
    <Heading as="h1" size="sm">
      Submit Payment
    </Heading>

    {/* Transaction Details */}
    <div className="tx-details">
      <div className="tx-detail-item">
        <p className="detail-header">Network</p>
        <p className="detail-value">{props.network}</p>
      </div>
      <div className="tx-detail-item">
        <p className="detail-header">To</p>
        <div className="dest-identicon">
          <Profile isShort publicAddress={props.destination} size="sm" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="tx-detail-item">
        <p className="detail-header">Amount</p>
        <p className="detail-value">
          {props.amount} {props.tokenSymbol}
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="tx-detail-item">
        <p className="detail-header">Fee</p>
        <p className="detail-value">{props.fee} XLM</p>
      </div>
      <div className="tx-detail-item">
        <p className="detail-header">Memo</p>
        <p className="detail-value">{props.memo}</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    {/* Signed XDR */}
    <div className="signed-xdr">
      <p className="detail-header">Signed XDR</p>
      <Card variant="secondary">
        <div className="xdr-copy">
          <IconButton
            altText="copy signed xdr data"
            icon={<Icon.ContentCopy key="copy-icon" />}
            onClick={() => copyContent(props.signedXdr)}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="xdr-data">{props.signedXdr}</div>
      </Card>
    </div>

    {/* Submit Button */}
    <div className="submit-row-confirm">
      <Button size="md" variant="tertiary" isFullWidth onClick={props.onClick}>
        Submit Payment
        {props.isSubmitting && <Loader />}
      </Button>
    </div>
  </>
);
```

The SubmitPayment component is responsible for rendering the UI of the Submit Payment step.
It receives the following props:

- `amount`: The amount to be sent in the payment.
- `destination`: The destination address for the payment.
- `fee`: The fee amount for the transaction.
- `isSubmitting`: A boolean indicating whether the payment is currently being submitted.
- `memo`: The memo associated with the payment.
- `network`: The network on which the payment is being made.
- `onClick`: A callback function to handle the click event when the payment is submitted.
- `signedXdr`: The signed XDR (transaction) data.
- `tokenSymbol`: The symbol of the token being used for the payment.

The component is divided into several sections:

- Heading: Displays the heading "Submit Payment" using the `Heading` component.

- Transaction Details: Displays various details related to the payment transaction, including the network, recipient, amount, fee, and memo. Each detail is rendered within a `tx-detail-item` container.

- Signed XDR: Displays the signed XDR data within a `Card` component. It also provides an option to copy the signed XDR data using the `IconButton` component with the copy icon.

- Submit Button: Renders a submit button using the `Button` component. The button text is "Submit Payment" and is accompanied by a `Loader` component if the payment is being submitted (`isSubmitting` is `true`).

### Step 8: Transaction Result

When the step count is 8, the `TxResult` component is rendered. This component displays the transaction result in the form of the transaction XDR. It also provides an `onClick` handler that resets the step count to 1, which takes the user back to the first step of the payment flow.

```tsx
case 8: {
  // Step 8: Render TxResult component
  const onClick = () => setStepCount(1);
  return <TxResult onClick={onClick} resultXDR={txResultXDR} />;
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the `TxResult` component:

```tsx
export const TxResult = (props: TxResultProps) => (
  <>
    <Heading as="h1" size="sm" addlClassName="title">
      Transaction Result
    </Heading>
    <div className="signed-xdr">
      <p className="detail-header">Result XDR</p>
      <Card variant="secondary">
        <div className="xdr-copy">
          <IconButton
            altText="copy result xdr data"
            icon={<Icon.ContentCopy key="copy-icon" />}
            onClick={() => copyContent(props.resultXDR)}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="xdr-data">{props.resultXDR}</div>
      </Card>
    </div>
    <div className="submit-row-send">
      <Button size="md" variant="tertiary" isFullWidth onClick={props.onClick}>
        Start Over
      </Button>
    </div>
  </>
);
```

The `TxResult` component is responsible for rendering the UI of the Transaction Result screen. It receives the following props:

- `resultXDR`: The result XDR (transaction) data.
- `onClick`: A callback function to handle the click event when the "Start Over" button is clicked.

The component is divided into three sections:

- Heading: Displays the heading "Transaction Result" using the `Heading` component with a custom CSS class name.

- Result XDR: Displays the result XDR data within a `Card` component. It also provides an option to copy the result XDR data using the `IconButton` component with the copy icon.

- Start Over Button: Renders a "Start Over" button using the `Button` component. This button is used to reset the payment process and start over from the beginning.

## Understanding Dapp Initialization

To initialize the Soroban React Payment Dapp, we need to clone and deploy the Soroban token smart contract. The Soroban token is a custom token that will be used to facilitate payments within the Dapp. Follow the steps below to build and deploy the smart contracts:

Clone the Soroban examples repository by running the following command in a new terminal window:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository:

```shell
cd soroban-examples
cd token
```

Build the smart contracts by running the `make` command:

```shell
make
```

This will compile the smart contracts and place them in the `token/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` directory.

Deploy the smart contracts to Futurenet. In the `soroban-examples/token` directory, open a terminal and follow these steps:

```shell
soroban contract deploy \
 --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_token_contract.wasm \
 --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY> \
 --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
 --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022'
```

This command uses the `soroban contract deploy` command to deploy the smart contracts to Futurenet.

Next we need to initialize the token contract by using the `soroban contract invoke` command:

```shell
soroban contract invoke \
 --id <TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID> \
 --source-account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY> \
 --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
 --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' \
 -- initialize \
 --admin <ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY> \
 --decimal 7 \
 --name '44656d6f20546f6b656e' \
 --symbol '"4454"'
```

In this step, we provide the following information:

- `Administrator Account`: This refers to the public key of the administrator account, which holds control and authority over the token contract, enabling management of various contract functionalities. You can refer to the [Soroban Token Interface](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/reference/interfaces/token-interface) to learn more about the administrator's role.
- `Decimal Precision`: We specify a precision value of 7, indicating that our token supports transactions with up to 7 decimal places. This level of precision allows for fine-grained control and flexibility when transferring token amounts.
- `Token Name`: The token's name is represented as a hex-encoded string. In this case, the hex code '44656d6f20546f6b656e' corresponds to the plain text name "Demo Token," providing a clear and recognizable label for our token.
- `Token Symbol`: Similarly, the token's symbol is encoded as a hex string. The hex code '4454' represents the plain text symbol "DT," serving as a concise and identifiable representation for our token.

Lastly, we need to mint some tokens to the sender's account. Run the following command, replacing` <TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID>`, `<ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY>`, and `<USER_PUBLIC_KEY> `with the corresponding values:

```shell
soroban contract invoke \
 --id <TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID> \
 --source-account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT_SECRET_KEY> \
 --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443 \
 --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' \
 -- mint \
 --to <USER_PUBLIC_KEY> \
 --amount 1000000000
```

This command will mint 100 tokens to the specified user's account.

The above steps ensure that the Soroban token smart contracts are deployed and initialized correctly, allowing the Dapp to leverage the token for payment functionalities.

To explore more commands available in the Soroban CLI, refer to the [Soroban CLI repo](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-tools/tree/main/cmd/soroban-cli/src/commands).

### Adding the Soroban Token to Freighter

To add the Soroban token to Freighter, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure your Freighter wallet is connected to the Dapp and that the experimental mode is enabled in Freighter settings: `(Settings(⚙️)>Preferences>ENABLE EXPERIMENTAL MODE).`

2. Open your Freighter wallet and click on the `Manage Assets` button at the bottom of the screen.

3. Then click on the `Add Soroban token ` button and enter the token ID that was returned when you deployed the smart contracts.

You should then see the Soroban token in your Freighter wallet.

Refer to [this section](./#checkpoint-4--add-the-token-to-freighter) of the challenge for a more detailed walkthrough.
