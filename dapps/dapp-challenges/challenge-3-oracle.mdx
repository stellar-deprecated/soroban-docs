This challenge will guide you through the process of building and shipping a oracle dapp on Stellar using Soroban. Oracle dapps (decentralized applications) provide the means for users to access real-world data and information from external sources and bring it on-chain. 

In this challenge, you will learn how to deploy smart contracts to Futurenet, and how to interact with them through a web frontend. In this context, the term "ship" refers to finalizing the development process of your dapp, ensuring that it functions as expected, and is accessible for user interaction and testing through a hosted frontend. However, it's crucial to clarify that despite its functionality, the dapp is not promoted nor intended for deployment in a production-level setting on Futurenet. The challenge is designed for educational purposes, helping you understand how a dapp can be built and interacted with, with further customization and development, it has the potential to evolve into a full-fledged, ready-to-use oracle solution.

## Checkpoint 0: üì¶ Install üìö

Start by installing the required dependencies.

Required:

- `soroban-cli alias` (installed in the next step)
- `Node` v18: [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `Freighter Wallet`: [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app/)

First, clone the Soroban Dapps Challenge repo and check out the `oracle` branch, which contains the code for the oracle smart contract that powers this dapp:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-dapps-challenge.git
cd soroban-dapps-challenge
git checkout oracle
```

Then, install soroban-cli alias by running the following command:

```sh
cargo install_soroban
```

Soroban CLI is the command line interface to Soroban. It allows you to build, deploy, and interact with smart contracts; configure identities; generate key pairs; manage networks; and more. The soroban-cli (alias) that is used in this challenge is a pinned version of the soroban-cli that is used in the Soroban Dapps Challenge. This ensures that the challenge is reproducible and that all participants are using the same version of Soroban.

## Checkpoint 1: üìù Setup the `initialize.sh` Script

The `initialize.sh` script is a shell script that will help you initialize the contracts and install dependencies. It is located in the top level directory.

The `initialize.sh` script performs following actions:
- Create a new wallet
- Fund wallet with test tokens
- Build and deploy contracts using this wallet
- Create typescript bindings
- Install dependencies

For this section, you'll need to configure parameters to initialize `donation` and `oracle` contracts.

You'll start with `donation` contract.

- First, Open `initialize.sh`:

- Find the following part at the end of the file:

  ```sh
  echo "Initialize the DONATION contract"
  ```

- For the `--recipient` parameter, specify the wallet address that will be used to withdraw money from the donation contract. This could be your address.

  ```sh
  initialize\
  --recipient <YOUR_WALLET> \
  ```

Now is the time for the `oracle` contract.

- Find the following part of `initialize.sh`:

  ```sh
  echo "Initialize the ORACLE contract"
  ```

- As you can see, there are several parameters that need to be specified here. 

  ```sh
   initialize \
   --caller <OWNER_ADDRESS> \
   --pair_name BTC_USDT \
   --epoch_interval <TIME_IS_SECONDS> \
   --relayer <RELAYER_ADDRESS>
  ```

  - `<OWNER_ADDRESS>` - the address that will become the owner of the contract. This could be your address. Only the contract owner will be able to change the `epoch_interval` and `relayer`;
  - `<TIME_IS_SECONDS>` - frequency (in seconds) of price updates;
  - `<RELAYER_ADDRESS>` - address of the wallet that will update the price (in the backend, in the CRON task). It is better to create a separate wallet for this (with test tokens);


## Checkpoint 2: üé¨ Deploy Smart Contracts

Now that you ths initialization script setup it's time to deploy the smart contracts to a Sandbox environment. Deploying a smart contract in a production setting involves submitting the contract code to the blockchain's main network ( Mainnet ), where it becomes part of the chain's immutable ledger. Deploying smart contracts to a Sandbox environment simulates that process without actually affecting Mainnet. When you deploy the smart contracts, you'll instead deploy to Futurenet, a test network with more cutting-edge features that have not yet been implemented in the Mainnet.

In your terminal, load the contracts and initialize them in the Sandbox environment by running the following commands:

```sh
npm run setup
```

> Note: This commmand may require write privelages in some cases. If you encounter a "Permission denied" error when running this command, run the following command to grant write privelages to the `initialize.sh` script:
>```sh
>chmod +x initialize.sh
>```

If the command runs successfully, your terminal will return a series of messages notifying you about the successful initialization of the contracts and the post-installation sequence.

```sh
Deploy the BTC TOKEN contract
Contract deployed succesfully with ID: CD5ZAJAPX5AAOB55G7SQEM63EQK5JRUZN2LUCDP66BRWV5HNGPDGJVDD
Deploy the DONATION contract
Contract deployed succesfully with ID: CC7U75NM4FQQSPLCSX2FTUCAQ6VI6VBA5LDYSU3FRKXN3X2W3AL2SAJ3
Deploy the ORACLE contract
Contract deployed succesfully with ID: CBK3VIRHK5QGHLKFTWHJI2ABMW2SATMIDPNQSCICCDRJU6DIFEWHLDD2
Initialize the BTC TOKEN contract

Done
Initialize the DONATION contract

Done
Initialize the ORACLE contract

Done

...
```

:::caution

Please, save your deployed contract ID, you will need it to complete the challenge.

### 4. ‚èØÔ∏è Create a CRON task

A CRON task is a scheduled operation performed at specified intervals, functioning as a customizable backend service. Here, you will be run a CRON task to update the BTC price within the Oracle contract.

The function is already implemented in the `cron-script.ts` file. You will need to specify the following parameters:

- Secret key of wallet (relayer) that will fetch BTC price from API and set it to smart contract;
- Contract address of deployed Oracle Contract;
- `API_KEY` from https://api-ninjas.com/api/cryptoprice (for free).

To run the CRON task, navigate to the `cron` directory and run:

```sh
npm install
node cron-script.ts
```

## Checkpoint 3: ü§ù Connect the Frontend to the Backend

Now that you have the smart contracts deployed, it's time to check out the frontend of your dapp.

First, start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should be able to see the frontend of your dapp.

> Note: Follow the instructions below and ensure that you have funded your wallet address that you intend to use from browser, otherwise the dapp display will be blank and a 'Account not found' will be printed on browser's console only. If you are using Freighter, be sure that you have properly configured the Freighter Wallet by following the instructions [here](../guides/wallets#connect-a-wallet-freighter).

Now that you have the frontend running, it's time to connect it with your smart contracts.

You will need to add some Futurenet network lumens to your wallet to interact with the dapp. Visit https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=futurenet, and follow the instructions to create and or fund an account on Futurenet.

> Note: These are test lumens for use with Futurenet and cannot be used on Mainnet

## Checkpoint 4: üåü Powering the Campaign

Fuel the vision! In this step, you will learn how to mint tokens and fund the crowdfunding campaign.

## Checkpoint 5: üö¢ Ship it! üöÅ

Now that your dapp is fully functional, its time to deploy it to a production environment. In this step, you will learn how to deploy your dapp to Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites that offers a quick and effective way to deploy the frontend of your dapp. This section requires that you have a [Vercel account] and the Vercel cli installed. 

If you don't have the Vercel cli installed, run the following command to install it globally:

```sh
npm i --global vercel
```

[Vercel account]: https://vercel.com/login

Next, you will need to remove the `target` directory to save space for the the deployment. Run the following command to remove the `target` directory:

```sh
rm -rf target
```

>Note: You can build this directory again by running `soroban contract build` in the `contracts/abundance` directory.

Next, you will use the Vercel cli to complete your deployment.

Run the following command to deploy your dapp:

```sh
npx vercel --prod
```

Then, continue through the prompts (you will not need to modify any settings) until you reach the completion prompt similar to the following:

```sh
Vercel CLI 30.1.1
üîó  Linked to julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp (created .vercel)
üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/julian-dev28/soroban-example-dapp/C1YZVQSqh6WcyR1uvxz8q2tW1tjD [2s]
