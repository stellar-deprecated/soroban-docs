# Scaffold-Soroban: Demonstrative Soroban Dapps

The **Soroban** team has invested considerable effort into contract implementation. They’ve built CLI’s and libraries, enabling contract builders to create and invoke using Rust, which forms the “backend” of Soroban. However, the “frontend”, which involves JS client libraries, required attention.

## Background

During the Soroban Hackathon, we recognized that while the frontend libraries were functional, their user experience was far from ideal. Furthermore, the lack of clear examples made it harder for dapp creators to design and understand Soroban's UX.

To tackle this, the **Wallet Eng** team, in collaboration with the Soroban team, has decided to launch “demo dapps”. These dapps demonstrate basic functionalities in a structured, easy-to-follow manner, primarily focusing on how to construct/deploy Soroban contract invocations.

## Dapp Demos

### 1. Payment Dapp

This dapp mirrors the Soroban payment flow in Freighter. It will:

- Use the wallet’s Soroban token balances to invoke the `xfer` method on the token’s contract.
- Submit the transaction to the network after Freighter’s signature.

### 2. Mint Token Dapp

This dapp allows a token admin to mint tokens. It will:

- Use the admin account to invoke the `mint` method on the token’s contract.
- Submit the transaction to the network post Freighter’s approval, minting tokens to the destination.

### 3. Atomic Swap Dapp

This dapp demonstrates a simplified swap between two tokens. It will:

- Use the wallet’s Soroban token balances to invoke the `swap` method on the atomic swap contract.
- Submit the transaction to the network after Freighter’s signature.

## Functionality Behind the DApps

With the introduction of these dapps, let's delve deeper into some of their standout features that showcase the power and innovation behind the dApps:

### 1. **Soroban Integration**

The library `'soroban-client'` is a core part of these dapps, enabling integration with the Soroban RPC. This offers the flexibility to build and submit transactions to the Soroban RPC on the Stellar network.

### 2. **Network Configuration**

These dapps can communicate across multiple network setups, thanks to the `RPC_URLS` and `getServer` functionalities. This adaptability is crucial for different development and deployment scenarios.

### 3. **Readable Token Information**

Retrieve user-friendly token information without the complexity of blockchain operations, using functions like `getTokenSymbol`, `getTokenName`, and `getTokenDecimals`.

### 4. **Simulation Before Committing**

With `simulateTx`, users can preview the outcome of a transaction before its actual execution. This enhances user confidence and ensures transaction accuracy.

### 5. **Convenient Conversion Functions**

Utilities like `accountToScVal` and `numberToI128` simplify the creation of transactions by converting intuitive inputs into the formats expected by the the Soroban RPC on the Stellar network.

### 6. **Token Transactions**

The `makePayment` function offers a streamlined way for "transfer" operations and also accommodates memos for added transaction-related information.

### 7. **Dynamic Fee Estimation**

Our `getEstimatedFee` function anticipates transaction fees, offering clarity on transaction costs to the users.
