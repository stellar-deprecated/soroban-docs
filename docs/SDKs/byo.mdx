# SDK: How to BYO (Build Your Own)

Soroban currently has one SDK for writing contracts in Rust, which can be found
[here][soroban-sdk].

To build SDKs for other languages a few things need to be included in the SDK to
provide contracts with the foundation they need to accept inputs, decode them,
store data, call other contracts, etc.

Below is a list of functionality a Soroban SDK needs to support those things, as
well as some details on what an SDK can provide in regards to testing
capabilities.

:::caution
The Soroban environment is under active development and API compatibility exists
guarantee exists at this time.

## Functionality

1. Value conversions

   - [RawVal] encode/decode
   - [Object] encode/decode
   - [Symbol] encode/decode

3. Host functions

   The host functions defined in [env.rs] are functions callable from within the
   WASM Guest environment. These need to be available to contracts to call, in
   some form, ideally wrapped so that contracts have a nicer interface.

5. SDK Types

   All the types in [soroban-sdk](https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk) should be
   supported. Notably:
   - [Map]
   - [Vec]
   - [Bytes]
   - [BigInt]

1. User Defined Types

   Contracts should be able to create user defined types, such as structs or
   unions, and have them be transmitted to the host for storing and transmitted
   back for loading.

   SDKs do this by converting objects to and from a `Val`. In the [soroban-sdk]
   this is referred to as a [RawVal].

   Structs with named fields should be translated into a `Map` with keys as
   `Symbol`s and the values as the field value, i.e. `Map<Symbol, V>`.

   Unions (or enums in some languages) with named variants should be translated
   into a `Vec` with the first element as a `Symbol` of the name of the variant,
   and zero or one additional elements representing a value stored with the
   variant.

7. Meta generation

   Contracts must contain a WASM custom section with name `contractenvmetav0`
   and containing a serialized
   [`SCEnvMetaEntry`](https://github.com/stellar/rs-stellar-xdr/blob/main/xdr/next/Stellar-contract-env-meta.x).
   The interface version stored within should match the version of the host
   functions supported.

9. Contract spec generation

   Contracts should contain a WASM custom section with name `contractspecv0` and
   containing a serialized stream of
   [`SCSpecEntry`](https://github.com/stellar/rs-stellar-xdr/blob/main/xdr/next/Stellar-contract-spec.x).
   There should be a `SCSpecEntry` for every function, struct, and union
   exported by the contract.

## Testing

Any Soroban SDK ideally provides a test environment for executing contract functions in the context of a Soroban runtime environment. The [soroban-sdk] does this by embedding the Soroban environment Rust library, [soroban-env-host].

The test environment should include:

- Invoking contract functions.
- Integration testing across multiple contracts.
