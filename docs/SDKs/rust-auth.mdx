title: Soroban Rust Auth SDK
---

The `soroban-auth` Rust crate contains the Soroban Rust Auth SDK. It provides
types and utilities for authenticating participants in a variety of ways including:
- Authenticating by being the invoker, as an Account ID or a Contract.
- Presigned invocations with accounts or ed25519 keys.

The Auth SDK identifies participants with the `Identifier` type, and
participants choose how they will be authenticated by providing a `Signature`.

An `Identifier` can represent a:
- Account ID
- Contract ID
- Ed25519 key

A `Signature` can be an:
- Invoker — An invoking transaction source account, or an invoking contract.
- Account – An invocation presigned with account signers.
– Ed25519 – An invocation presigned with an ed25519 key.

Intended for use alongside the [`soroban-sdk`].
