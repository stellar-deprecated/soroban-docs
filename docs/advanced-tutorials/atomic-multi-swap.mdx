The [atomic swap batching example] swaps a pair of tokens between the two groups
of users that authorized the `swap` operation from the [Atomic Swap] example.

This contract basically batches the multiple swaps while following some simple
rules to match the swap participants.

Follow the comments in the code for more information.
