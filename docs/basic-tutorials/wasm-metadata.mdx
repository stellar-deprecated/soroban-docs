description: A macro that allows you to write structured metadata into the Wasm custom section.
---

The [contractmeta!] macro provided in the Rust SDK allows users to write two
strings - a `key` and a `val` - within a serialized `SCMetaEntry::SCMetaV0` XDR
object to the custom section of Wasm contracts. The section name for this
metadata is `contractmetav0`. Developers can utilize this macro to write
metadata, and tools can then read and display this information to users.

The [liquidity pool example] provides a clear demonstration of how to use the
`contractmeta!` macro:

```rust

// Metadata that is added on to the Wasm custom section
contractmeta!(
    key = "Description",
    val = "Constant product AMM with a .3% swap fee"
);

pub trait LiquidityPoolTrait {...
```
