# Token Contract

The token contract is an implementation of [CAP-54 Smart Contract Standardized Asset].

[CAP-54 Smart Contract Standardized Asset]: https://stellar.org/protocol/cap-54

:::caution
The token contract is in early development, has not been audited, and is not
intended for use. Report issues
[here](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/issues/new/choose).

## Overview

Tokens are a vital part of blockchains, and contracts that implement token
functionality are inevitable on any smart contract platform. A built-in token
contract has a number of advantages over token contracts written by the
ecosystem. First, we can special case this contract and run it natively instead
of running in a WASM VM, reducing the cost of using the contract. Second, we
can use this built-in contract to allow "classic" Stellar assets to interoperate
with Soroban. The current iteration of the standard token contract doesn't
interoperate with "classic" Stellar assets, but this feature will be available
in the future. Note that this standard token contract does not prevent the
ecosystem from developing other token contracts if the standard is missing
functionality they require.

The standard token contract is similar to the widely used ERC-20 token standard,
which should make it easier for existing smart contract developers to get
started on Stellar.

## Token contract authorization semantics

See the [advanced auth example](../examples/auth-advanced) for an overview of
authorization.

### Token operations

The token contract contains three kinds of operations

- getters, such as `balance`, which do not change the state of the contract
- unprivileged mutators, such as `approve` and `xfer`, which change the state of
the contract but do not require special privileges
- privileged mutators, such as `burn` and `set_admin`, which change the state of
the contract but require special privileges

Gettors require no authorization because they do not change the state of the
contract and all contract data is public. For example, `balance` simply returns
the balance of the specified identity without changing it.

Unprivileged mutators require authorization from some identity. The identity
which must provide authorization will vary depending on the unprivileged
mutator. For example, a "grantor" can use `approve` to allow a "spender" to spend
the grantor's money up to some limit. So for approve, the grantor must provide
authorization. Similarly, a "sender" can use `xfer` to send money to a
"recipient". So for `xfer`, the sender must provide authorization.

Priviliged mutators require authorization from a specific privileged identity,
known as the "administrator". For example, only the administrator can `mint` more
of the asset. Similarly, only the administrator can appoint a new administrator.

### Replay prevention

The token contract provides replay prevention by using a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce).
The messages that are signed to provide authorization contain a nonce. The
contract also stores a nonce per identity. When checking signatures, the
contract loads the nonce for the relevant identity. When an operation succeeds,
the nonce stored in the contract is incremented. This makes it impossible to
reuse a signature.

The current nonce for an identity can be retrieved using the `nonce` contract
function.

### Example: Signing payloads

The [example](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/d24fbeaa3cad5406bee8b64e748a71fa38c7c2f3/src/testutils.rs#L48-L70)
from the test `Token` wrapper class demonstrate how you sign a payload for the
token contract.

```rust
pub fn approve(&self, from: &Keypair, spender: &Identifier, amount: &BigInt) {
    let from_id = to_ed25519(&self.env, from);
    let nonce = self.nonce(&from_id);

    let msg = SignaturePayload::V0(SignaturePayloadV0 {
        function: symbol!("approve"),
        contract: self.contract_id.clone(),
        network: self.env.ledger().network_passphrase(),
        args: (from_id, &nonce, spender, amount).into_val(&self.env),
    });

    let auth = Signature::Ed25519(Ed25519Signature {
        public_key: from.public.to_bytes().into_val(&self.env),
        signature: from.sign(msg).unwrap().into_val(&self.env),
    });
    TokenClient::new(&self.env, &self.contract_id).approve(&auth, &nonce, &spender, &amount)
}
```

## Contract Interface

```rust
// Sets the administrator to "admin". Also sets some metadata
fn initialize(e: Env, admin: Identifier, decimal: u32, name: Bytes, symbol: Bytes);

// Admin interface -- these functions are privileged

// If "admin" is the administrator, burn "amount" from "from"
fn burn(e: Env, admin: Signature, nonce: BigInt, from: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// If "admin" is the administrator, mint "amount" to "to"
fn mint(e: Env, admin: Signature, nonce: BigInt, to: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// If "admin" is the administrator, set the administrator to "id"
fn set_admin(e: Env, admin: Signature, nonce: BigInt, new_admin: Identifier);

// If "admin" is the administrator, freeze "id"
fn freeze(e: Env, admin: Signature, nonce: BigInt, id: Identifier);

// If "admin" is the administrator, unfreeze "id"
fn unfreeze(e: Env, admin: Signature, nonce: BigInt, id: Identifier);

// Token Interface

// Get the allowance for "spender" to transfer from "from"
fn allowance(e: Env, from: Identifier, spender: Identifier) -> BigInt;

// Set the allowance to "amount" for "spender" to transfer from "from"
fn approve(e: Env, from: Signature, nonce: BigInt, spender: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// Get the balance of "id"
fn balance(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> BigInt;

// Transfer "amount" from "from" to "to"
fn xfer(e: Env, from: Signature, nonce: BigInt, to: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// Transfer "amount" from "from" to "to", consuming the allowance of "spender"
fn xfer_from(
    e: Env,
    spender: Signature,
    nonce: BigInt,
    from: Identifier,
    to: Identifier,
    amount: BigInt,
);

// Returns true if "id" is frozen
fn is_frozen(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> bool;

// Returns the current nonce for "id"
fn nonce(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> BigInt;

// Descriptive Interface

// Get the number of decimals used to represent amounts of this token
fn decimals(e: Env) -> u32;

// Get the name for this token
fn name(e: Env) -> Bytes;

// Get the symbol for this token
fn symbol(e: Env) -> Bytes;
```
