# Token Contract

The token contract is an implementation of [CAP-46-6 Smart Contract Standardized Asset].

[CAP-46-6 Smart Contract Standardized Asset]: https://stellar.org/protocol/cap-46-06

:::caution
The token contract is in early development, has not been audited, and is
intended for use in development and testing only at this stage.. Report issues
[here](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/issues/new/choose).

## Overview

Tokens are a vital part of blockchains, and contracts that implement token
functionality are inevitable on any smart contract platform. A built-in token
contract has a number of advantages over token contracts written by the
ecosystem. First, we can special case this contract and run it natively instead
of running in a WASM VM, reducing the cost of using the contract. Second, we
can use this built-in contract to allow "classic" Stellar assets to interoperate
with Soroban. Note that this standard token contract does not prevent the
ecosystem from developing other token contracts if the standard is missing
functionality they require.

The standard token contract is similar to the widely used ERC-20 token standard,
which should make it easier for existing smart contract developers to get
started on Stellar.

## Token contract authorization semantics

See the [advanced auth example](../examples/auth-advanced) for an overview of
authorization.

### Token operations

The token contract contains three kinds of operations

- getters, such as `balance`, which do not change the state of the contract
- unprivileged mutators, such as `approve` and `xfer`, which change the state of
the contract but do not require special privileges
- privileged mutators, such as `burn` and `set_admin`, which change the state of
the contract but require special privileges

Getters require no authorization because they do not change the state of the
contract and all contract data is public. For example, `balance` simply returns
the balance of the specified identity without changing it.

Unprivileged mutators require authorization from some identity. The identity
which must provide authorization will vary depending on the unprivileged
mutator. For example, a "grantor" can use `approve` to allow a "spender" to spend
the grantor's money up to some limit. So for approve, the grantor must provide
authorization. Similarly, a "sender" can use `xfer` to send money to a
"recipient". So for `xfer`, the sender must provide authorization.

Priviliged mutators require authorization from a specific privileged identity,
known as the "administrator". For example, only the administrator can `mint` more
of the asset. Similarly, only the administrator can appoint a new administrator.

### Replay prevention

The token contract provides replay prevention by using a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce).
The messages that are signed to provide authorization contain a nonce. The
contract also stores a nonce per identity. When checking signatures, the
contract loads the nonce for the relevant identity. When an operation succeeds,
the nonce stored in the contract is incremented. This makes it impossible to
reuse a signature.

The current nonce for an identity can be retrieved using the `nonce` contract
function.

### Example: Invoker auth

The easiest way to use the built-in token with classic accounts is to just use
the [invoker](../examples/auth.mdx#invoker) auth. In this way there won't be
a need to sign the contract payload, so the contract call would look like this:

```rust
// `with_source_account` is a testing utility, but the contract call arguments
// would be the same for the real contract call too.
token.with_source_account(&token_admin_id).mint(
    // No signature needed, just a flag that invoker auth should be used, i.e.
    // `token_admin_id` in this case.
    &Signature::Invoker,
    // Nonce is always 0 for invokers.
    &0,
    &user_id,
    &1000,
);
```

See a more complete example that uses invoker auth in the tests 
[here](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/blob/51a95262caba3f8ac466fa8bbc07004ad297ae13/timelock/src/test.rs#L60).

### Example: Signing payloads

The payload signature semantics is the same as for regular contracts using 
[advanced auth](../examples/auth-advanced.mdx). The following snippet shows how
should the signature payload look like:

```rust
let nonce = token.nonce(&token_admin_id);
// This is the test call, but the contract call arguments and signature payload
// would be the same for the real contract call too.
let sig = soroban_auth::testutils::ed25519::sign(
    &env,
    // Signer has the private key of the admin.
    &token_admin_signer,
    // Identifier of the token contract.
    &token_contract_id,
    // Name of the contract function we call.
    symbol!("mint"),
    // Arguments of the contract function call.
    // Notice that instead of the signature (first `mint` argument), public key
    // is used as the first argument here.
    (&token_admin_id, &nonce, &user_id, &1000),
);
// Call the contract with signature we computed above.
token.mint(
    &sig,
    &nonce,
    &user_id,
    &1000,
);
```

## Interacting with classic Stellar assets

Token contract is the only way to interact with 'classic' Stellar assets in 
Soroban. 'Classic' assets include native Stellar token (lumens) and all the 
existing trustlines.

For every 'classic' asset exactly one respective token contract can be deployed
via `create_token_from_asset` host function. The resulting token will have a
deterministic identifier. The issuer of the asset will be the administrator of
the deployed contract. Native Stellar token doesn't have an administrator.

After the contract has been deployed the users can use `import` function to move
part of their existing balance to the contract or `export` to move the token 
balance back to their 'classic' balance. Otherwise, the token will behave in
exactly the same way as any other token, i.e. users that don't have a 
corresponding trustline or even a Stellar account can still use it (with the 
exception of the `import`/`export` functions).

## Contract Interface

This interface can be found in the [SDK](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/blob/47895a87b98a2fb8dd882839df7abde03f6c7fc6/soroban-token-spec/src/lib.rs#L27). It
extends the common [token interface](../common-interfaces/token.mdx) with
`import`/`export` functions for classic asset interactions.

```rust
// The metadata used to initialize token (doesn't apply to contracts representing 
// 'classic' Stellar assets).
pub struct TokenMetadata {
    pub name: Bytes,
    pub symbol: Bytes,
    pub decimals: u32,
}

// Initializes a 'smart-only' token by setting its admin and metadata.
// Tokens that represent 'classic' Stellar assets don't need to call this, as
// their metadata is inherited from the existing assets.
fn init(env: Env, admin: Identifier, metadata: TokenMetadata);

// Functions that apply on for tokens representing classic assets.

// Moves the `amount` from classic asset balance to the token balance of `id`
// user.
// `id` must be a classic Stellar account (i.e. an account invoker or signature 
// signed by an account).
fn import(env: Env, id: Signature, nonce: i128, amount: i64);

// Moves the `amount` from token balance to the classic asset balance of `id`
// user.
// `id` must be a classic Stellar account (i.e. an account invoker or signature 
// signed by an account).
fn export(env: Env, id: Signature, nonce: i128, amount: i64);

// Admin interface -- these functions are privileged

// If "admin" is the administrator, burn "amount" from "from"
fn burn(e: Env, admin: Signature, nonce: i128, from: Identifier, amount: i128);

// If "admin" is the administrator, mint "amount" to "to"
fn mint(e: Env, admin: Signature, nonce: i128, to: Identifier, amount: i128);

// If "admin" is the administrator, set the administrator to "id"
fn set_admin(e: Env, admin: Signature, nonce: i128, new_admin: Identifier);

// If "admin" is the administrator, freeze "id"
fn freeze(e: Env, admin: Signature, nonce: i128, id: Identifier);

// If "admin" is the administrator, unfreeze "id"
fn unfreeze(e: Env, admin: Signature, nonce: i128, id: Identifier);

// Token Interface

// Get the allowance for "spender" to transfer from "from"
fn allowance(e: Env, from: Identifier, spender: Identifier) -> i128;

// Set the allowance to "amount" for "spender" to transfer from "from"
fn approve(e: Env, from: Signature, nonce: i128, spender: Identifier, amount: i128);

// Get the balance of "id"
fn balance(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> i128;

// Transfer "amount" from "from" to "to"
fn xfer(e: Env, from: Signature, nonce: i128, to: Identifier, amount: i128);

// Transfer "amount" from "from" to "to", consuming the allowance of "spender"
fn xfer_from(
    e: Env,
    spender: Signature,
    nonce: i128,
    from: Identifier,
    to: Identifier,
    amount: i128,
);

// Returns true if "id" is frozen
fn is_frozen(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> bool;

// Returns the current nonce for "id"
fn nonce(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> i128;

// Descriptive Interface

// Get the number of decimals used to represent amounts of this token
fn decimals(e: Env) -> u32;

// Get the name for this token
fn name(e: Env) -> Bytes;

// Get the symbol for this token
fn symbol(e: Env) -> Bytes;
```
