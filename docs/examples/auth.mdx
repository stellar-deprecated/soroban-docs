The [auth example] demonstrates how to tell who has invoked a contract, and
verify that a contract has been invoked by an account or contract. This example
is an extension of the [storing data example].

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)][oigp]
[oigp]: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.4.2

[events example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.4.2/events
[storing data example]: storing-data.mdx

The participant who invoked a contract is an `Address` containing one-of a:

- Account ID
- Contract ID

In this example, data is stored associated with an `Address` after
authorization has been verified.

:::info

For contracts that would benefit from supporting auth with presigned
invocations, or ed25519 keys independent of accounts and contracts, see the
[advanced auth example].

[advanced auth example]: auth-advanced.mdx

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v0.4.2` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v0.4.2 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `auth` directory, and use
`cargo test`.

```
cd auth
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="auth/src/lib.rs"
#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    Counter(Address),
}

pub struct IncrementContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl IncrementContract {
    /// Increment increments a counter for the invoker, and returns the value.
    pub fn increment(env: Env) -> u32 {
        // Construct a key for the data being stored. Use an enum to set the
        // contract up well for adding other types of data to be stored.
        let invoker = env.invoker();
        let key = DataKey::Counter(invoker);

        // Get the current count for the invoker.
        let mut count: u32 = env
            .storage()
            .get(&key)
            .unwrap_or(Ok(0)) // If no value set, assume 0.
            .unwrap(); // Panic if the value of COUNTER is not u32.

        // Increment the count.
        count += 1;

        // Save the count.
        env.storage().set(&key, count);

        // Return the count to the caller.
        count
    }
}
```

## How it Works

The example contract tracks a counter for each invoker.

Open the `auth/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

### Invoker

The invoker is an `Address` of the account or contract that directly
invoked the contract function.

```rust
let invoker = env.invoker();
```

The `env.invoker()` always returns the invoker of the currently executing
contract. It will return either:

- `Account` with an `AccountId` if the contract was invoked directly by an
  account.
- `Contract` with a `BytesN<32>` contract ID if the contract was invoked by
  another contract.

Contracts should not need to unpack the `Address` for most use cases. Contracts
should treat the value as opaque wherever possible so that they are
interoperable with accounts and contracts.

The `Address` value can be used as a key in storage to store data for a user.
The example contract only reads and writes data for the authenticated invoker,
and so the only thing that can access or change the data for an invoker, is the
invoker themselves.

:::tip

Enum keys like `DataKey` can be a helpful way to store a variety of different
types of data keyed against the same or similar things. In the example the
counter for each address is stored against `DataKey::Counter(Address)`. If the
contract needs to start storing other types of data for addresses, it can do so
by adding additional variants to the enum.

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    Counter(Address),
}
```

```rust
let invoker = env.invoker();
let key = DataKey::Counter(invoker);
```

### Tests

Open the `auth/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="auth/src/test.rs"
#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, IncrementContract);
    let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let user_1 = env.accounts().generate();
    let user_2 = env.accounts().generate();

    assert_eq!(client.with_source_account(&user_1).increment(), 1);
    assert_eq!(client.with_source_account(&user_1).increment(), 2);
    assert_eq!(client.with_source_account(&user_2).increment(), 1);
    assert_eq!(client.with_source_account(&user_1).increment(), 3);
}

```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

The contract is registered with the environment using the contract type.

```rust
let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, IncrementContract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a
generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract
type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is
`IncrementContract`, and the client is named `IncrementContractClient`.

```rust
let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
```

The contract generates account IDs for two users.

The `generate` function creates a new account ID that the test can use to
represent an account interacting with the contract.

```rust
let _ = env.accounts().generate();
```

The `increment` function is invoked twice with `user_1` configured as the source
account and therefore the invoker. The results are asserted to be `1` and `2`
because it is the first and second increments for the user.

```rust
assert_eq!(client.with_source_account(&user_1).increment(), 1);
assert_eq!(client.with_source_account(&user_1).increment(), 2);
```

The `increment` function is invoked once with `user_2` configured as the source
account. The results are asserted to be `1` because it is the first increment
for the user. The first users data is separate to that of the second users. The
users have no access to each others data.

```rust
assert_eq!(client.with_source_account(&user_2).increment(), 1);
```

:::tip

Functions invoked in tests can use `with_source_account(account_id)` to simulate
an invocation from an account, and the invoked function will see `env.invoker()`
as `Address::Account(account_id)`.

## Build the Contract

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

The `.wasm` file should be found in the `../target` directory after building:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke functions on the contract.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --account GDQHNBKFCO666SPX4RS62VTDY7H5W2QXHVVVQCDTADTOI3IYZGEOZL6V \
    --fn increment
```

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --account GC24I42QMKKR4NE6IYNPCQHUO4PXWXDGNZ7QVMMSR5EWAYSGKBHPLGHH \
    --fn increment
```

Run these commands several times to increment the counters for each account.

View the data that has been stored against each user with `soroban read`.

```sh
soroban read --id 1
```

```
"[""Counter"",[""Account"",""GC24I42QMKKR4NE6IYNPCQHUO4PXWXDGNZ7QVMMSR5EWAYSGKBHPLGHH""]]",1
"[""Counter"",[""Account"",""GDQHNBKFCO666SPX4RS62VTDY7H5W2QXHVVVQCDTADTOI3IYZGEOZL6V""]]",3
```
