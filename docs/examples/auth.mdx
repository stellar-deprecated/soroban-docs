The [auth example] demonstrates how to tell who has invoked a contract, and
verify that a contract has been invoked by an account or contract.

The participant who invoked a contract is an `Address` containing one-of a:
- Account ID
- Contract ID

In this example, data is stored associated with an `Address` after
authorization has been verified.

:::info
For contracts that would benefit from supporting auth with presigned
invocations, or ed25519 keys independent of accounts and contracts, see the
[advanced auth example].
:::

[auth example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.0.4/auth
[advanced auth example]: auth-advanced.mdx

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v0.0.4` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v0.0.4 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `auth` directory, and use
`cargo test`.

```
cd auth
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="auth/src/lib.rs"
#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    SavedNum(Address),
    Admin,
}

pub struct ExampleContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl ExampleContract {
    /// Set the admin Address.
    ///
    /// May be called only once unauthenticated, and
    /// then only by current admin.
    pub fn set_admin(env: Env, new_admin: Address) {
        let admin = Self::admin(&env);
        if let Some(admin) = admin {
            assert_eq!(env.invoker(), admin);
        }
        env.data().set(DataKey::Admin, new_admin);
    }

    /// Set the number for an authenticated address.
    pub fn set_num(env: Env, num: BigInt) {
        let id = env.invoker();
        env.data().set(DataKey::SavedNum(id), num);
    }

    /// Get the number for an Address.
    pub fn num(env: Env, id: Address) -> Option<BigInt> {
        env.data().get(DataKey::SavedNum(id)).map(Result::unwrap)
    }

    /// Overwrite any number for an Address.
    /// Callable only by admin.
    pub fn overwrite(env: Env, id: Address, num: BigInt) {
        let admin = Self::admin(&env);
        assert_eq!(Some(env.invoker()), admin);

        env.data().set(DataKey::SavedNum(id), num);
    }

    fn admin(env: &Env) -> Option<Address> {
        env.data().get(DataKey::Admin).map(Result::unwrap)
    }
}
```

## How it Works

The example contract tracks users with two roles. A single admin exists. Anyone
can set the admin at deployment, and once set only the admin can set a new
admin. Any other user can interact with the contract to store a number. Only the
user and the admin can change the number stored for that user.

Open the files above to follow along.

### `set_admin` Function

The `set_admin` function is used to set an admin for the contract. It can be
invoked once without authentication to set the first admin. Subsequent
invocations must be by the current admin.

The current admin is retrieved from stored data using the `DataKey::Admin` enum
key.  If a value is set, the function only continues if the `env.invoker()` is
the same `Invoker` as `admin`.

The `env.invoker()` always returns the invoker of the currently executing
contract. It will return either:
- `Account` with an `AccountId` if the contract was invoked directly by an
account.
- `Contract` with a `BytesN<32>` contract ID if the contract was invoked by
another contract.

Contracts should use the `Invoker` type and in most cases ignore what type of
invoker it is.

If the invoker is the admin, or this is the first invocation of the function,
the `new_admin` `Invoker`, which will be either an account or a contract, will
be stored.

```rust
pub fn init(env: Env, new_admin: Address) {
    let admin = Self::admin(&env);
    if let Some(admin) = admin {
        assert_eq!(env.invoker(), admin);
    }
    env.data().set(DataKey::Admin, new_admin);
}

fn admin(env: &Env) -> Option<Address> {
    env.data().get(DataKey::Admin).map(Result::unwrap)
}
```

### `set_num` Function

The `set_num` function is used by any user who wishes to store a number. The
number is stored in the contract data map keyed by the invoker. The contract can
retrieve the number whenever it has the same `Invoker`.

The invoker is wrapped in the data key to distinguish this specific piece of
data from other data the contract might store in the future for invokers.

```rust
pub fn set_num(env: Env, num: BigInt) {
    let addr = env.invoker();
    env.data().set(DataKey::SavedNum(addr), num);
}
```

### `num` Function

The `num` function is used by any user who wishes to retrieve the number stored
against any other user. No authentication occurs because the invoker is not used
and is otherwise ignored.

```rust
pub fn num(env: Env, addr: Address) -> Option<BigInt> {
    env.data().get(DataKey::SavedNum(addr)).map(Result::unwrap)
}
```

### Tests

Open the `auth/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="auth/src/test.rs"
#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, ExampleContract);
    let client = ExampleContractClient::new(&env, contract_id);

    // Initialize contract by setting the admin.
    let admin = env.accounts().generate();
    let admin_address = &Address::Account(admin.clone());
    client.set_admin(admin_address);

    // Check if user 1 has a num, it doesn't yet.
    let user1 = env.accounts().generate();
    let user1_address = &Address::Account(user1.clone());
    assert_eq!(client.num(user1_address), None);

    // Have user 1 set a num for themselves.
    let five = BigInt::from_u32(&env, 5);
    client.with_source_account(&user1).set_num(&five);
    assert_eq!(client.num(user1_address), Some(five));

    // Have admin overwrite user 1's num.
    let ten = BigInt::from_u32(&env, 10);
    client
        .with_source_account(&admin)
        .overwrite(user1_address, &ten);
    assert_eq!(client.num(user1_address), Some(ten));
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

The contract is registered with the environment using the contract type.

```rust
let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, ExampleContract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a
generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract
type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is
`ExampleContract`, and the client is named `ExampleContractClient`.

```rust
let client = ExampleContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
```

The contract generates account IDs for an admin and a user, and invokes the
`set_admin` and `set_num` functions respectively.

The `generate` function creates a new account ID that the test can use to
represent an account interacting with the contract.
```rust
let _ = env.accounts().generate();
```

The `set_admin` function is invoked as is since no authentication is required on
its first call.

```rust
client.set_admin(admin_address);
```

The `set_num` function is invoked with `user1` configured as the source account
and therefore the invoker.

```rust
let five = BigInt::from_u32(&env, 5);
client.with_source_account(&user1).set_num(&five);
```

Functions invoked in tests can use `with_source_account(account_id)` to simulate
an invocation from an account, and the invoked function will see `env.invoker()`
as `Address::Account(account_id)`.

## Build the Contract

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

The `.wasm` file should be found in the `../target` directory after building:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke functions on the contract.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --account GDQHNBKFCO666SPX4RS62VTDY7H5W2QXHVVVQCDTADTOI3IYZGEOZL6V \
    --fn set_num \
    --arg 5
```

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --account GC24I42QMKKR4NE6IYNPCQHUO4PXWXDGNZ7QVMMSR5EWAYSGKBHPLGHH \
    --fn set_num \
    --arg 10
```

View the data that has been stored against each user with `soroban read`.

```
soroban read --id 1
"[""SavedNum"",[""Account"",""GDQHNBKFCO666SPX4RS62VTDY7H5W2QXHVVVQCDTADTOI3IYZGEOZL6V""]]","""5"""
"[""SavedNum"",[""Account"",""GC24I42QMKKR4NE6IYNPCQHUO4PXWXDGNZ7QVMMSR5EWAYSGKBHPLGHH""]]","""10"""
