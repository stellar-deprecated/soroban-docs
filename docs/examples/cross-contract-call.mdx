title: Cross Contract Calls
---

The [cross contract call example] demonstrates how to call a contract from
another contract.

:::info
In this example both contracts will be compiled into a single
contract binary, but the same principles apply for contracts compiled
separately.
:::

[cross contract call example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/cross_contract_calls

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the examples repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `cross_contract_calls`
directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd cross_contract_calls
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="cross_contract_calls/src/a.rs"
pub struct ContractA;

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl ContractA {
    pub fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
        x.checked_add(y).expect("no overflow")
    }
}
```

```rust title="cross_contract_calls/src/b.rs"
pub struct ContractB;

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl ContractB {
    pub fn add_with(env: Env, x: u32, y: u32, contract_id: FixedBinary<32>) -> u32 {
        env.invoke_contract(
            &contract_id,
            &Symbol::from_str("add"),
            vec![&env, x.into_env_val(&env), y.into_env_val(&env)],
        )
    }
}
```

## How it Works

Cross contract calls are made by invoking another contract by its contract ID,
specifying the function to call as a `Symbol`, and passing a series of
arguments.

Open the `cross_contract_calls/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

## The Contract to be Called

The contract to be called is a simple contract that accepts `x` and `y`
parameters, adds them together and returns the result.

```rust title="cross_contract_calls/src/a.rs"
pub struct ContractA;

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl ContractA {
    pub fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
        x.checked_add(y).expect("no overflow")
    }
}
```

:::tip
The contract uses the `checked_add` method to ensure that there is no overflow,
and if there is overflow, panics rather than returning an overflowed value.
Rust's primitive integer types all have checked operations available as
functions with the prefix `checked_`.
:::

## The Contract doing the Calling

The contract that does the calling accepts the same parameters to pass through,
but also accepts a contract ID of the contract to call. In many contracts the
contract to call might have been stored as contract data and be retrieved, but
in this simple example it is being passed in as a parameter each time.

The `Env` `invoke_contract` function is used to invoke the other contract.

The function name of the other contract is specified as a `Symbol`.

The arguments are specified as a `Vec<EnvVal>`, which can be created using the
the `vec![&env, ...]` macro. Each value can be converted into an `EnvVal` using
the `.into_env_val(&env)` function.

```rust title="cross_contract_calls/src/a.rs"
pub struct ContractB;

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl ContractB {
    pub fn add_with(env: Env, x: u32, y: u32, contract_id: FixedBinary<32>) -> u32 {
        env.invoke_contract(
            &contract_id,
            &Symbol::from_str("add"),
            vec![&env, x.into_env_val(&env), y.into_env_val(&env)],
        )
    }
}
```

## Tests

Open the `cross_contract_calls/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="cross_contract_calls/src/test.rs"
#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();

    let contract_a = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
    env.register_contract(&contract_a, ContractA);

    let contract_b = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [1; 32]);
    env.register_contract(&contract_b, ContractB);

    // Invoke 'add_with' on contract B.
    let sum = add_with::invoke(
        &env,
        &contract_b,
        // Value X.
        &5,
        // Value Y.
        &7,
        // Tell contract B to call contract A.
        &contract_a,
    );

    assert_eq!(sum, 12);
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

Contracts must be registered with the environment with a contract ID, which is a
32-byte value. Both contracts `a` and `b` are registered with unique IDs.

```rust
let contract_a = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
env.register_contract(&contract_a, ContractA);
```

```rust
let contract_b = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [1; 32]);
env.register_contract(&contract_b, ContractB);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have an `invoke` function generated, that can be
used to invoke the contract function within the environment.

The test invokes contract `b`'s `add_width` function with two values to add, and
the contract ID of contract `a`.

```rust
// Invoke 'add_with' on contract B.
let sum = add_with::invoke(
    &env,
    &contract_b,
    // Value X.
    &5,
    // Value Y.
    &7,
    // Tell contract B to call contract A.
    &contract_a,
);
```

The test asserts that the result that is returned is as we expect.

```rust
assert_eq!(sum, 12);
```

## Build the Contract

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `../target` directory:

```
../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_cross_contract_calls_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions. Both
contracts live in the same compiled contract and so we'll deploy the contract
twice. The first deployment we'll use as the callee, and the second as the
caller.

```sh
soroban-cli deploy \
    --wasm ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_cross_contract_calls_contract.wasm \
    --id 0
```

```sh
soroban-cli deploy \
    --wasm ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_cross_contract_calls_contract.wasm \
    --id 1
```

Invoke contract `1`'s `add_with` function, passing in values for `x` and `y`
(e.g.  as `5` and `7`), and then pass in the contract ID of contract 0.

```sh
soroban-cli invoke \
    --id 1 \
    --fn add_with \
    --arg 5 \
    --arg 7 \
    --arg '[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]'
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```json
12
```

Contract `1`'s `add_width` function invoked contract `0`'s `add` function to do
the addition.

:::info
The `soroban-cli` is under active development and at this time accepts contract
IDs as JSON formatted number arrays. That's what the long `[0,0,0,...]` value is
in the invoke command above.
