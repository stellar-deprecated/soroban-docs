The [deployer example] demonstrates how to deploy contracts using a contract.

:::info
In this example there are two contracts that are compiled separately, and the
tests deploy one with the other.
:::

[deployer example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.1.0/deployer

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v0.1.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v0.1.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `deployer/deployer`
directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd deployer/deployer
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="deployer/deployer/src/lib.rs"
pub struct Deployer;

#[contractimpl]
impl Deployer {
    /// Deploy the contract wasm and after deployment invoke the init function
    /// of the contract with the given arguments. Returns the contract ID and
    /// result of the init function.
    pub fn deploy(env: Env, salt: Bytes, wasm: Bytes, init_fn: Symbol, init_args: Vec<RawVal>) -> (BytesN<32>, RawVal) {
        // Deploy the wasm.
        let id = env.deployer().with_current_contract(salt).deploy(wasm);
        // Invoke the init function with the given arguments.
        let res: RawVal = env.invoke_contract(&id, &init_fn, init_args);
        // Return the contract ID of the deployed contract and the result of
        // invoking the init result.
        (id, res)
    }
}
```

## How it Works

Contracts can deploy other contracts by using the SDK.

The contract ID of the deployed contract is deterministic and is derived from
the deploying contract ID and the provided salt.

Open the `deployer/deployer/src/src.rs` file to follow along.

### Deployer

The `deployer` contract deploys other contracts. It accepts a salt that will be
used to derive a contract ID, and a WASM bytes to deploy. It also accepts an
initialization function and arguments to pass to that function.

The contract first gets a deployer using the salt, then calls deploy with the
WASM bytes. The WASM bytes will be deployed and the contract ID for that new
contract is returned. The contract ID is deterministic and is derived from the
deploying contract and the salt.

```rust
let id = env.deployer().with_current_contract(salt).deploy(wasm);
```

The contract invokes the new contract's intialization function and passes
through the arguments.

```rust
let res: RawVal = env.invoke_contract(&id, &init_fn, init_args);
```

The contract returns the new contract ID and the result of the initializatio function.
```rust
(id, res)
```

### Tests

Open the `deployer/deployer/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="deployer/deployer/src/test.rs"
// The contract that will be deployed by the deployer contract.
mod contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file = "../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm"
    );
}

#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let deployer_id = BytesN::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
    env.register_contract(&deployer_id, Deployer);
    let client = DeployerClient::new(&env, &deployer_id);

    // Deploy contract using deployer, and include an init function to call.
    let salt = Bytes::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
    let wasm: Bytes = contract::WASM.into_val(&env);
    let init_fn = symbol!("init");
    let init_fn_args = (5u32,).into_val(&env);
    let (contract_id, init_result) = client.deploy(&salt, &wasm, &init_fn, &init_fn_args);
    assert_eq!(
        contract_id,
        bytesn!(&env, 0xead19f55aec09bfcb555e09f230149ba7f72744a5fd639804ce1e934e8fe9c5d)
    );
    assert!(init_result.is_void());

    // Invoke contract to check that it is initialized.
    let client = contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
    let sum = client.value();
    assert_eq!(sum, 5);
}
```

The test imports a test contract from the `soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm`
file.

```rust
mod contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file = "../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm"
    );
}
```

That contract contains the following code, which exports a couple
functions that sets a value in the initialization function and allows the value
to be retrieved from another function. The test contract will be used when
testing the deployer, by deploying the contract and then checking if the
contract is deployed by invoking its functions.

```rust title="deployer/contract/src/lib.rs"
pub struct Contract;

const KEY: Symbol = symbol!("value");

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn init(env: Env, value: u32) {
        env.data().set(KEY, value);
    }
    pub fn value(env: Env) -> u32 {
        env.data().get_unchecked(KEY).unwrap()
    }
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

A fixed contract ID is used so that we can assert on the contract ID of the
contract that gets deployed, which will be derived in part from the deployers
contract ID.

```rust
let deployer_id = BytesN::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
```

The deployer contract is registered with the environment.

```rust
env.register_contract(&deployer_id, Deployer);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a
generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract
type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is
`Deployer`, and the client is named `DeployerClient`.

```rust
let client = DeployerClient::new(&env, &deployer_id);
```

The client is used to invoke the `deploy` function. The contract will deploy the
test contract WASM bytes, call the `"init"` function, and pass in a single
`5u32` argument.

```rust
let salt = Bytes::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
let wasm: Bytes = contract::WASM.into_val(&env);
let init_fn = symbol!("init");
let init_fn_args = (5u32,).into_val(&env);
let (contract_id, init_result) = client.deploy(&salt, &wasm, &init_fn, &init_fn_args);
assert_eq!(
    contract_id,
    bytesn!(&env, 0xead19f55aec09bfcb555e09f230149ba7f72744a5fd639804ce1e934e8fe9c5d)
);
assert!(init_result.is_void());
```

The test checks that the test contract was deployed by using its client to
invoke it and get back the value set during initialization.

```rust
let client = contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
let sum = client.value();
assert_eq!(sum, 5);
```

## Build the Contracts

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command. Build
both the deployer contract and the test contract.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Both `.wasm` files should be found in the `../target` directory after building
both contracts:

```
../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_contract.wasm
```

```
../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke the contract function to
deploy the test contract.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_contract.wasm \
    --id 0 \
    --fn deploy \
    --arg 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \
    --arg $(xxd -p -c- target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm) \
    --arg init \
    --arg '[{"u32":5}]'
```

And then invoke the deployed test contract.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --id ead19f55aec09bfcb555e09f230149ba7f72744a5fd639804ce1e934e8fe9c5d \
    --fn value
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```json
5
```
