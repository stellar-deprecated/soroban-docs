The [events example] demonstrates how to publish events from a contract.

[events example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/events

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the examples repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `events` directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd events
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="events/src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, map, symbol, Env, Symbol};

pub struct EventsContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl EventsContract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> () {
        let events = env.events();
        let topics = (symbol!("Hello"), to);
        let data = map![&env, (1u32, 2u32)];
        events.publish(topics, data);
    }
}
```

## How it Works

This example contract is similar to the [hello world example]. It also contains one 
contract function named `hello`. However, instead of returning the greeting message to the caller, it 
publishes the message (along with some data) as a contract event.

[hello world example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/main/hello_world

Contract events let smart contract developers emit information about what their
contract is doing.

Contracts can publish events using the `Events` object retrieved from the
environment.

```rust
let events = env.events();
```

### Event Topics
An event may contain up to four topics, each topic can be any type except:
- `Vec`
- `Map`
- `Bytes` longer than 32 bytes
- `[contracttype]`


Topics are conveniently defined using a tuple. In the sample code two topics of
`Symbol` type are used.

```rust
let topics = (symbol!("Hello"), to);
```

### Event Data
An event also contains a data object of any value or type including types
defined by contracts using `[contracttype]`. In the sample code the data is a
small map where key `1` maps to value `2`.

```rust
let data = map![&env, (1u32, 2u32)];
```

:::tip
The topics don't have to be made of the same type. You can mix different types as long as the total topic count stays below the limit. 
:::

### Publishing
Publishing an event is done by calling the `publish` function and giving it the
topics and data.  The function returns nothing on success, and panics on
failure. Possible failure reasons can include malformed inputs (e.g. topic count
exceeds limit) and running over the resource budget (TBD). Once successfully
published, the new event will be recorded by the [host environment].

```rust
events.publish(topics, data);
```

[host environment]: ../learn/high-level-overview#host-environment

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `../target` directory:

```
../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_events_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions in the
using it.

```sh
soroban-cli invoke \
    --wasm ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_events_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --fn hello \
    --arg friend
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```json
null
Event #0:
{"ext":"v0","contractId":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],"type":"contract","body":{"v0":{
    "topics":[{"symbol":[72,101,108,108,111]},{"symbol":[102,114,105,101,110,100]}],
    "data":{"object":{"map":[{"key":{"u32":1},"val":{"u32":2}}]}}}}}
```

The `null` just indicates the `hello` contract function returned nothing (which
means success).

A single event `Event #0` is outputted, which is the contract event the contract
published. The event contains the two topics, each a `symbol` (displayed as
bytes), and the data object containing the `map`.

:::info
The soroban-cli is under active development and at this time outputs events in
an unstable JSON format. The format is TBD.
