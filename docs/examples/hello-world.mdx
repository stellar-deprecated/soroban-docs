The [hello world example] demonstrates how to write a simple contract, with a
single function that takes one input and returns it as an output.

[hello world example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.0.4/hello_world

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v0.0.4` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v0.0.4 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `hello_world` directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd hello_world
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="hello_world/src/lib.rs"
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, symbol, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct HelloContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl HelloContract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        vec![&env, symbol!("Hello"), to]
    }
}
```
Ref: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.0.4/hello_world

## How it Works

Soroban contracts export all public functions that are within `impl` blocks that
have been annotated with `#[contractimpl]`. In the example above the contract
exports a single function, `hello`.

Contract functions must be given names that are no more than 10 characters long.

Open the `hello_world/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

### Contract Type

Contract functions must be defined within an `impl` block, and therefore a type
is required for the impl to be attached. A simple zero-sized struct can be used.

```rust
pub struct HelloContract;
```

### Contract Function

Contract functions look much like regular Rust functions. They mave have any
number of arguments, but arguments must support being transmitted to and from
the Soroban environment that the contract runs in. The Soroban SDK provides some
types like `Vec`, `Map`, `BigInt`, `Symbol`, `Bytes`, `BytesN`, etc that
can be used. Primitive values like `u64`, `i64`, `u32`, `i32`, and `bool` can
also be used. Floats are not supported.

Contract inputs must not be references.

If the first argument of a contract function is of the `soroban_sdk::Env` type,
an `Env` will be provided that provides access to additional functionality. Most
functionality within the SDK requires an `Env`, so it is recommended to have it
in the argument list for most functions.

```rust
#[contractimpl]
impl HelloContract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        ...
    }
}
```

## Tests

Open the `hello_world/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="hello_world/src/test.rs"
#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = BytesN::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
    env.register_contract(&contract_id, HelloContract);
    let client = HelloContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let words = client.hello(&symbol!("SourBun"));
    assert_eq!(words, vec![&env, symbol!("Hello"), symbol!("Dev"),]);
}
```

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

Contracts must be registered with the environment with a contract ID, which is a
32-byte value.

```rust
let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
env.register_contract(&contract_id, HelloContract);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a
generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract
type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is
`HelloContract`, and the client is named `HelloContractClient`.

```rust
let client = HelloContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
let words = client.hello(&symbol!("Dev"));
```

The values returned by functions can be asserted on:
```rust
assert_eq!(words, vec![&env, symbol!("Hello"), symbol!("Dev"),]);
```

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `../target` directory:

```
../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_hello_world_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban`] installed, you can invoke contract functions in the
using it.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm ../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_hello_world_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --fn hello \
    --arg friend
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```json
["Hello","friend"]
```
