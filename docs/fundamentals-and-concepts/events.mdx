description: The mechanism that off-chain applications use to monitor contract changes.

Events are the mechanism that applications off-chain can use to monitor changes and events in contracts on-chain.

## How are events emitted?
`ContractEvents` are emitted in Stellar Core's `TransactionMeta`. You can see in
the [TransactionMetaV3] XDR below that there is a list of `OperationEvents`
called `events`. Each `OperationEvent` corresponds to an operation in a
transaction, and itself contains a list of `ContractEvents`. Note that `events`
will only be populated if the transaction succeeds. Take a look at [this
example](../basic-tutorials/events.mdx) to learn more about how to emit an event
in your contract.

[TransactionMetaV3]: #transactionmetav3

### ContractEvent
```c++
struct ContractEvent
{
    // We can use this to add more fields, or because it
    // is first, to change ContractEvent into a union.
    ExtensionPoint ext;

    Hash* contractID;
    ContractEventType type;

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        struct
        {
            SCVec topics;
            SCVal data;
        } v0;
    }
    body;
};
```
### OperationEvents
```c++
struct OperationEvents
{
    ContractEvent events<>;
};
```
### TransactionMetaV3
```c++
struct TransactionMetaV3
{
    LedgerEntryChanges txChangesBefore; // tx level changes before operations
                                        // are applied if any
    OperationMeta operations<>;         // meta for each operation
    LedgerEntryChanges txChangesAfter;  // tx level changes after operations are
                                        // applied if any
    OperationEvents events<>;           // custom events populated by the
                                        // contracts themselves. One list per operation.
    TransactionResult txResult;

    Hash hashes[3];                     // stores sha256(txChangesBefore, operations, txChangesAfter),
                                        // sha256(events), and sha256(txResult)

    // Diagnostics events that are not hashed. One list per operation.
    // This will contain all contract and diagnostic events. Even ones
    // that were emitted in a failed contract call.
    OperationDiagnosticEvents diagnosticEvents<>;
};
```

## What are diagnosticEvents?

While looking at the `TransactionMetaV3` XDR struct above, you may have noticed
the `diagnosticEvents` field. This list will be empty by default unless your
stellar-core instance has `ENABLE_SOROBAN_DIAGNOSTIC_EVENTS=true` in its config
file. If diagnostic events are enabled, this list will not only include all ContractEvents in `events`, but will also include events from failed contract calls, and additional diagnostic events emitted by the host. These events can be identified by `type == DIAGNOSTIC`, and they're defined below.

### fn_call
The `fn_call` diagnostic event is emitted when a contract is called
and contains -
* Topics
   1. The symbol "fn_call".
   2. The contract id of the contract about to be called.
   3. A symbol containing the name of the function being called.
* Data
  1. A vector of the arguments passed to the function being called. 

### fn_return
The `fn_return` diagnostic event is emitted when a contract call completes and contains -
* Topics
   1. The symbol "fn_return".
   2. A symbol containing the name of the function that is about to return.
* Data
  1. The value returned by the contract function. 


### When should diagnostic events be enabled?

`events` contain `ContractEvents` that should convey information about state
changes. `diagnosticEvents` on the other hand contain events that are not
useful for most users, but may be helpful in debugging issues or building the
contract call stack. Because they won't be used by most users, they can be
optionally enabled because they are not hashed into the ledger, and therefore
are not part of the protocol. This is done so a
stellar-core node can stay in sync with the network while emitting these events
that normally would not be useful for most users.

Due to the fact that a node with diagnostic events enabled will be excuting code
paths that diverge from a regular node, we highly encourage only using this
feature on watcher node (nodes where `NODE_IS_VALIDATOR=false` is set).
