## Example SDK Usage

Some (but not all yet) of the Stellar SDKs have functions built-in to handle most of the process of building a Stellar transaction to interact with a Soroban smart contract. Below, we demonstrate in JavaScript and Python how to build and submit a Stellar transaction that will invoke an instance of the [increment example](../getting-started/storing-data) smart contract.

The [`soroban-client`](https://stellar.github.io/js-soroban-client/) JavaScript SDK is a new library that can be used alongside the existing JavaScript SDKs for Stellar. All you need to do is install it using your preferred package manager.

```bash
npm install --save soroban-client
```

The [`py-stellar-base`](https://stellar-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/soroban/) Python SDK has implemented experimental support for interacting with Soroban smart contracts. You can install it from the `soroban` branch of the library's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StellarCN/py-stellar-base/tree/soroban). Note: If you already use this SDK for interacting with the Stellar network, you may want to consider installing the `soroban` branch in a virtualenv of some sort.

## XDR Usage

Stellar supports invoking and deploying contracts with a new operation named `InvokeHostFunctionOp`. The [`soroban-cli`] abstracts these details away from the user, but not all SDKs do yet. If you're building a dapp you'll probably find yourself building the XDR transaction to submit to the network.

The `InvokeHostFunctionOp` can be used to perform the following Soroban operations:

- Invoke contract functions.
- Upload Wasm of the new contracts.
- Deploy new contracts using the uploaded Wasm or built-in implementations (this currently includes only the [token contract](../advanced-tutorials/stellar-asset-contract.mdx)).

[`soroban-cli`]: ../getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli

There is only a single `InvokeHostFunctionOp` allowed per transaction. Contracts
should be used to perform multiple actions atomically, for example, to deploy
a new contract and initialize it atomically.

### InvokeHostFunctionOp

The XDR of `HostFunction` and `InvokeHostFunctionOp` below can be found
[here][XDR].

[XDR]: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/e372df9f677961aac04c5a4cc80a3667f310b29f/Stellar-transaction.x#L581

```cpp
union HostFunction switch (HostFunctionType type)
{
case HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_INVOKE_CONTRACT:
    InvokeContractArgs invokeContract;
case HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT:
    CreateContractArgs createContract;
case HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_UPLOAD_CONTRACT_WASM:
    opaque wasm<>;
};

struct InvokeHostFunctionOp
{
    // Host function to invoke.
    HostFunction hostFunction;
    // Per-address authorizations for this host function.
    SorobanAuthorizationEntry auth<>;
};
```

#### Function

The `hostFunction` in `InvokeHostFunctionOp` will be executed by the Soroban host environment. The supported functions are:

1. `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_INVOKE_CONTRACT`

   - This will invoke a function of the deployed contract with arguments
     specified in `invokeContract` struct.

   ```cpp
   struct InvokeContractArgs {
    SCAddress contractAddress;
    SCSymbol functionName;
    SCVal args<>;
   };
   ```

   `contractAddress` is the address of the contract to invoke, `functionName` is
   the name of the function to invoke and `args` are the arguments to pass to
   that function.

2. `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_UPLOAD_CONTRACT_WASM`
   - This will upload the contract Wasm using the provided `wasm` blob.
   - Uploaded Wasm can be identified by the SHA-256 hash of the uploaded Wasm.
3. `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT`

   - This will deploy a contract instance to the network using the specified
     `executable`. The 32-byte contract identifier is based on `contractIDPreimage`
     value and the network identifier (so every network has a separate contract
     identifier namespace).

   ```cpp
   struct CreateContractArgs
   {
       ContractIDPreimage contractIDPreimage;
       ContractExecutable executable;
   };
   ```

   - `executable` can be either a SHA-256 hash of the previously uploaded Wasm
     or it can specify that a built-in contract has to be used:

   ```cpp
   enum ContractExecutableType
   {
       CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_WASM = 0,
       CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_TOKEN = 1
   };

   union ContractExecutable switch (ContractExecutableType type)
   {
   case CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_WASM:
       Hash wasm_hash;
   case CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_TOKEN:
       void;
   };
   ```

   - `contractIDPreimage` is defined as following:

     ```cpp
     union ContractIDPreimage switch (ContractIDPreimageType type)
     {
     case CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ADDRESS:
         struct
         {
             SCAddress address;
             uint256 salt;
         } fromAddress;
     case CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ASSET:
         Asset fromAsset;
     };
     ```

     - The final contract identifier is created by computing SHA-256 of this
       together with the network identifier as a part of [`HashIDPreimage`]:

     [`HashIDPreimage`]: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/e372df9f677961aac04c5a4cc80a3667f310b29f/Stellar-transaction.x#L697

     ```cpp
     union HashIDPreimage switch (EnvelopeType type)
     {
     ...
     case ENVELOPE_TYPE_CONTRACT_ID:
         struct
         {
             Hash networkID;
             ContractIDPreimage contractIDPreimage;
         } contractID;
     ...
     ```

     - `CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ADDRESS` specifies that the contract will be created
       using the provided address and salt. This operation has to be authorized by
       `address` (see the following section for details).
     - `CONTRACT_ID_FROM_ASSET` specifies that the contract will be created using the
       Stellar asset. This is only supported when `executable == CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_TOKEN`.
       Note, that the asset doesn't need to exist when this is applied, however the issuer of the asset will be the initial token administrator. Anyone can deploy asset contracts.

#### Authorization Data

Soroban's [authorization framework](../fundamentals-and-concepts/authorization.mdx)
provides a standardized way for passing authorization data to the contract
invocations via `SorobanAuthorizationEntry` structures.

```cpp
struct SorobanAuthorizationEntry
{
    SorobanCredentials credentials;
    SorobanAuthorizedInvocation rootInvocation;
};

union SorobanCredentials switch (SorobanCredentialsType type)
{
case SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_SOURCE_ACCOUNT:
    void;
case SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS:
    SorobanAddressCredentials address;
};
```

`SorobanAuthorizationEntry` contains a tree of invocations with `rootInvocation`
as a root. This tree is authorized by a user specified in `credentials`.

`SorobanAddressCredentials` have two options:

- `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_SOURCE_ACCOUNT` - this simply uses the signature of the
  transaction (or operation, if any) source account and hence doesn't require any
  additional payload.
- `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS` - contains `SorobanAddressCredentials` with the
  following structure:
  ```cpp
  struct SorobanAddressCredentials
  {
      SCAddress address;
      int64 nonce;
      uint32 signatureExpirationLedger;
      SCVec signatureArgs;
  };
  ```
  The fields of this structure have the following semantics:
  - When `address` is the address that authorizes invocation.
  - `signatureExpirationLedger` the ledger sequence number on which the
    signature expires. Signature is still considered valid on
    `signatureExpirationLedger`, but it is no longer valid on
    `signatureExpirationLedger + 1`. It is recommended to keep this as small as
    viable, as it makes the transaction cheaper.
  - `nonce` is an arbitrary value that is unique for all the signatures
    performed by `address` until `signatureExpirationLedger`. A good approach to
    generating this is to just use a random value.
  - `signatureArgs` - signature (or multiple signatures) that sign the 32-byte
    SHA-256 hash of `ENVELOPE_TYPE_SOROBAN_AUTHORIZATION` preimage
    ([XDR][envelope-xdr]). The signature structure is defined by the account
    contract corresponding to the `Address` (see below for the Stellar account
    signature structure).

`SorobanAuthorizedInvocation` defines a node in the authorized invocation tree:

```cpp
struct SorobanAuthorizedInvocation
{
    SorobanAuthorizedFunction function;
    SorobanAuthorizedInvocation subInvocations<>;
};

union SorobanAuthorizedFunction switch (SorobanAuthorizedFunctionType type)
{
case SOROBAN_AUTHORIZED_FUNCTION_TYPE_CONTRACT_FN:
    SorobanAuthorizedContractFunction contractFn;
case SOROBAN_AUTHORIZED_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT_HOST_FN:
    CreateContractArgs createContractHostFn;
};

struct SorobanAuthorizedContractFunction
{
    SCAddress contractAddress;
    SCSymbol functionName;
    SCVec args;
};
```

`SorobanAuthorizedInvocation` consists of the `function` that is being authorized
(either contract function or a host function) and the authorized sub-invocations
that `function` performs (if any).

`SorobanAuthorizedFunction` has two variants:

- `SOROBAN_AUTHORIZED_FUNCTION_TYPE_CONTRACT_FN` is a contract function that
  includes the address of the contract, name of the function being invoked, and
  arguments of the `require_auth`/`require_auth_for_args` call performed on behalf
  of the address. Note, that if `require_auth[_for_args]` wasn't called, there
  shouldn't be a `SorobanAuthorizedInvocation` entry in the transaction.
- `SOROBAN_AUTHORIZED_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT_HOST_FN` is authorization
  for `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT` or for `create_contract` host function
  called from a contract. It only contains the `CreateContractArgs` XDR structure
  corresponding to the created contract.

Building `SorobanAuthorizedInvocation` trees may be simplified by using the
recording auth mode in Soroban preflight (see the [docs][preflight-doc] for more
details).

[preflight-doc]: ../fundamentals-and-concepts/interacting-with-contracts.mdx#authorization

##### Stellar Account Signatures

`signatureArgs` format is user-defined for the [custom accounts], but it is
protocol-defined for the Stellar accounts.

The signatures for the Stellar account are a vector of the following Soroban
[structures] in the Soroban SDK format:

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub struct AccountEd25519Signature {
    pub public_key: BytesN<32>,
    pub signature: BytesN<64>,
}
```

[structures]: https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/blob/99d8c92cdc7e5cd0f5311df8f88d04658ecde7d2/soroban-env-host/src/native_contract/account_contract.rs#L51
[custom accounts]: ../fundamentals-and-concepts/authorization.mdx#account-abstraction

### Transaction resources

Every Soroban transaction has to have a `SorobanTransactionData` transaction
[extension] populated. This is needed to compute the
[Soroban resource fee](../fundamentals-and-concepts/fees-and-metering.mdx).

[extension]: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/c2e702c70951ff59a1eff257f08cf38d47210e5f/Stellar-transaction.x#L874

The Soroban transaction data is defined as follows:

```cpp
struct SorobanResources
{
    // The ledger footprint of the transaction.
    LedgerFootprint footprint;
    // The maximum number of instructions this transaction can use
    uint32 instructions;

    // The maximum number of bytes this transaction can read from ledger
    uint32 readBytes;
    // The maximum number of bytes this transaction can write to ledger
    uint32 writeBytes;
};

struct SorobanTransactionData
{
    SorobanResources resources;
    // Portion of transaction `fee` allocated to refundable fees.
    int64 refundableFee;
    ExtensionPoint ext;
};
```

This data comprises two parts: Soroban resources and the `refundableFee`. The
`refundableFee` is the portion of the transaction fee eligible for refund. It
includes the fees for the contract events emitted by the transaction, the return
value of the host function invocation, and fees for the [ledger space rent](./state-expiration.mdx).

The `SorobanResources` structure includes the ledger footprint and the resource
values, which together determine the resource consumption limit and the
resource fee. The footprint must contain the `LedgerKey`s that will be read
and/or written.

The simplest method to determine the values in `SorobanResources` and
`refundableFee` is to use the transaction simulation with
[preflight service](../fundamentals-and-concepts/interacting-with-contracts.mdx#preflight).
