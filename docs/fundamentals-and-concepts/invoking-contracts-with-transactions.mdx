description: A description of the InvokeHostFunctionOp operation.
---

Stellar supports invoking and deploying contracts with a new Operation named `InvokeHostFunctionOp`. The [`soroban-cli`] abstracts these details away from the user, but SDKs do not yet and if you're building a dapp you'll probably find yourself building the XDR transaction to submit to the network.

The `InvokeHostFunctionOp` can be used to perform the following Soroban operations:

- Invoke contract functions.
- Upload Wasm of the new contracts.
- Deploy new contracts using the uploaded Wasm or built-in implementations (this currently includes only the [token contract](../advanced-tutorials/stellar-asset-contract.mdx)).

[`soroban-cli`]: ../getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli

There is only a single `InvokeHostFunctionOp` allowed per transaction. Contracts
should be used to perform multiple actions atomically, for example, to deploy
a new contract and initialize it atomically.

## InvokeHostFunctionOp

The XDR of `HostFunction` and `InvokeHostFunctionOp` below can be found
[here][XDR].

[XDR]: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/e372df9f677961aac04c5a4cc80a3667f310b29f/Stellar-transaction.x#L581

```c++
union HostFunction switch (HostFunctionType type)
{
case HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_INVOKE_CONTRACT:
    SCVec invokeContract;
case HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT:
    CreateContractArgs createContract;
case HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_UPLOAD_CONTRACT_WASM:
    opaque wasm<>;
};

struct InvokeHostFunctionOp
{
    // Host function to invoke.
    HostFunction hostFunction;
    // Per-address authorizations for this host function.
    SorobanAuthorizationEntry auth<>;
};
```

### Function

The `hostFunction` in `InvokeHostFunctionOp` will be executed by the Soroban host environment. The supported functions are:

1. `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_INVOKE_CONTRACT`
   - This will invoke a function of the deployed contract with arguments 
   specified in `invokeContract` vector.
   - `invokeContract` arguments are expected to contain the contract id 
   `SCBytes`, contract function name `SCSymbol`, and the arguments of the 
   contract function being invoked.
2. `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_UPLOAD_CONTRACT_WASM`
   - This will upload the contract Wasm using the provided `wasm` blob.
   - Uploaded Wasm can be identified by the SHA-256 hash of the uploaded Wasm.
3. `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT`
   - This will deploy a contract instance to the network using the specified 
   `executable`. The 32-byte contract identifer is based on `contractIDPreimage`
   value and the network identifier (so every network has a separate contract
   identifier namespace).
        ```c++
        struct CreateContractArgs
        {
            ContractIDPreimage contractIDPreimage;
            ContractExecutable executable;
        };
        ```
   - `executable` can be either a SHA-256 hash of the previously uploaded Wasm
   or it can specify that a built-in contract has to be used:
        ```c++
        enum ContractExecutableType
        {
            CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_WASM = 0,
            CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_TOKEN = 1 
        };

        union ContractExecutable switch (ContractExecutableType type)
        {
        case CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_WASM:
            Hash wasm_hash;
        case CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_TOKEN:
            void;
        };
        ```

    - `contractIDPreimage` is defined as following:
        ```c++
        union ContractIDPreimage switch (ContractIDPreimageType type)
        {
        case CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ADDRESS:
            struct
            {
                SCAddress address;
                uint256 salt;
            } fromAddress;
        case CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ASSET:
            Asset fromAsset;
        };
        ```
        - The final contract identifier is created by computing SHA-256 of this
        together with the network identifier as a part of [`HashIDPreimage`]:

        [`HashIDPreimage`]: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/e372df9f677961aac04c5a4cc80a3667f310b29f/Stellar-transaction.x#L697

        ```c++
        union HashIDPreimage switch (EnvelopeType type)
        {
        ...
        case ENVELOPE_TYPE_CONTRACT_ID:
            struct
            {
                Hash networkID;
                ContractIDPreimage contractIDPreimage;
            } contractID;
        ...
        ```
        - `CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ADDRESS` specifies that the contract will be created
        using the provided address and salt. This operation has to be authorized by
        `address` (see the following section for details).
        - `CONTRACT_ID_FROM_ASSET` specifies that the contract will be created using the
        Stellar asset. This is only supported when `executable == CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_TOKEN`.
        Note, that the asset doesn't need to exist when this is applied, however the issuer of the asset will be the initial token administrator. Anyone can deploy asset contracts.


### Authorization Data

Soroban [authorization framework](../fundamentals-and-concepts/authorization.mdx)
provides a standardized way for passing authorization data to the contract 
invocations via `SorobanAuthorizationEntry` structures.

```c++
struct SorobanAuthorizationEntry
{
    SorobanCredentials credentials;
    SorobanAuthorizedInvocation rootInvocation;
};

union SorobanCredentials switch (SorobanCredentialsType type)
{
case SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_SOURCE_ACCOUNT:
    void;
case SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS:
    SorobanAddressCredentials address;
};
```

`SorobanAuthorizationEntry` contains a tree of invocations with `rootInvocation`
as a root. This tree is authorized by a user specified in `credentials`.

`SorobanAddressCredentials` have 2 options:

- `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_SOURCE_ACCOUNT` - this simply uses the signature of the
transaction (or operation, if any) source account and hence doesn't require any
additional payload.
- `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS` - contains `SorobanAddressCredentials` with the
  following structure:
  ```c++
  struct SorobanAddressCredentials
  {
      SCAddress address;
      int64 nonce;
      uint32 signatureExpirationLedger;    
      SCVec signatureArgs;
  };
  ```
  The fields of this structure have the following semantics:
    - When `address` is the address that authorizes invocation.
    - `signatureExpirationLedger` the ledger sequence number on which the 
    signature expires. Signature is still considered valid on 
    `signatureExpirationLedger`, but it is no longer valid on 
    `signatureExpirationLedger + 1`. It is recommended to keep this as small as
    viable, as it makes the transaction cheaper.
    - `nonce` is an arbitrary value that is unique for all the signatures of
    performed by `address` until `signatureExpirationLedger`. A good approach to
    generating this is to just use a random value.
    - `signatureArgs` - signature (or multiple signatures) that sign the 32-byte
    SHA-256 hash of `ENVELOPE_TYPE_SOROBAN_AUTHORIZATION` preimage
    ([XDR][envelope-xdr]). The signature structure is defined by the account
    contract corresponding to the `Address` (see below for the Stellar account
    signature structure).

`SorobanAuthorizedInvocation` defines a node in the authorized invocation tree:

```c++
struct SorobanAuthorizedInvocation
{
    SorobanAuthorizedFunction function;
    SorobanAuthorizedInvocation subInvocations<>;
};

union SorobanAuthorizedFunction switch (SorobanAuthorizedFunctionType type)
{
case SOROBAN_AUTHORIZED_FUNCTION_TYPE_CONTRACT_FN:
    SorobanAuthorizedContractFunction contractFn;
case SOROBAN_AUTHORIZED_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT_HOST_FN:
    CreateContractArgs createContractHostFn;
};

struct SorobanAuthorizedContractFunction 
{
    SCAddress contractAddress;
    SCSymbol functionName;
    SCVec args;
};
```

`SorobanAuthorizedInvocation` consists of the `function` that is being authorized
(either contract function or a host function) and authorized sub-invocations
that `function` performs (if any).

`SorobanAuthorizedFunction` has two variants:
- `SOROBAN_AUTHORIZED_FUNCTION_TYPE_CONTRACT_FN` is a contract function that
includes the address of the contract, name of the function being invoked and
arguments of `require_auth`/`require_auth_for_args` call performed on behalf
of the address. Note, that if `require_auth[_for_args]` wasn't called, there
shouldn't be a `SorobanAuthorizedInvocation` entry in the transaction.
- `SOROBAN_AUTHORIZED_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT_HOST_FN` is authorization
for `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT` or for `create_contract` host function
called from a contract. It only contains the `CreateContractArgs` XDR structure
corresponding to the created contract.


Building `SorobanAuthorizedInvocation` trees may be simplified by using the
recording auth mode in Soroban preflight (see the [docs][preflight-doc] for more
details).

#### Stellar Account Signatures

`signatureArgs` format is user-defined for the [custom accounts], but it is
protocol-defined for the Stellar accounts.

The signatures for the Stellar account are a vector of the following Soroban
[structures] in the Soroban SDK format:

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub struct AccountEd25519Signature {
    pub public_key: BytesN<32>,
    pub signature: BytesN<64>,
}
```

[structures]: https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/blob/99d8c92cdc7e5cd0f5311df8f88d04658ecde7d2/soroban-env-host/src/native_contract/account_contract.rs#L51
[custom accounts]: ../fundamentals-and-concepts/authorization.mdx#account-abstraction

## Transaction resources

Every Soroban transaction has to have a `SorobanTransactionData` transaction 
[extension] populated. This is needed to compute the
[Soroban resource fee](../fundamentals-and-concepts/fees-and-metering.mdx).

[extension]: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/c2e702c70951ff59a1eff257f08cf38d47210e5f/Stellar-transaction.x#L874

The Soroban transaction data is defined as follows:

```c++
struct SorobanResources
{   
    // The ledger footprint of the transaction.
    LedgerFootprint footprint;
    // The maximum number of instructions this transaction can use
    uint32 instructions; 

    // The maximum number of bytes this transaction can read from ledger
    uint32 readBytes;
    // The maximum number of bytes this transaction can write to ledger
    uint32 writeBytes;

    // Maximum size of dynamic metadata produced by this contract (
    // currently only includes the events).
    uint32 extendedMetaDataSizeBytes;
};

struct SorobanTransactionData
{
    SorobanResources resources;
    // Portion of transaction `fee` allocated to refundable fees.
    int64 refundableFee;
    ExtensionPoint ext;
};
```

This data comprises two parts: Soroban resources and the refundableFee. The
`refundableFee` is the portion of the transaction fee eligible for refund. It
should currently be no less than the metadata fee of the transaction.

The `SorobanResources` structure includes the ledger footprint and the resource
values, which together determine the resource consumption limit and the
resource fee. The footprint must contain the `LedgerKey`s that will be read
and/or written.

The simplest method to determine the values in `SorobanResources` is to use the
transaction simulation with
[preflight service](../fundamentals-and-concepts/interacting-with-contracts.mdx#preflight).
