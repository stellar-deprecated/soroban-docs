To recap what we've done so far, in [Setup](setup.mdx):

- we set up our local environment to write Rust smart contracts
- installed the soroban-cli
- configured the soroban-cli to communicate with a test Stellar network via RPC
- and configured an identity to sign transactions

In [Hello World](hello-world.mdx) we wrote a simple contract, and now we are ready to deploy that contract to a test network, and interact with it.

## Deploy

To deploy your Hello Soroban contract, run the following command:

<Tabs groupId="test-networks">
<TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_soroban.wasm \
  --source alice \
  --network testnet
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local">

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_soroban.wasm \
  --source alice \
  --network local
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This returns the ID of the contract, starting with a `C`. Let's put it somewhere semi-permanent so we can use it later. Copy that value and put it into a file in the `.soroban` directory called `hello-id`. You may need to create the `.soroban` folder first with `mkdir .soroban`.

```bash
echo "C...[your contract id here]" > .soroban/hello-id
```

## Interact

Using the code we wrote in [Write a Contract](hello-world.mdx#write-a-contract) and the resulting `.wasm` file we built in [Build](hello-world.mdx#build), run the following command to invoke the `hello` function.

:::info

In the background, the CLI is making RPC calls. For information on that checkout out the [RPC](../reference/rpc.mdx) reference page.

:::

Here we're setting the `to` argument to `RPC`. This again makes use of command expansion `$(...)`; see the note about that in the [Configure an Identity](setup.mdx#configure-an-identity) section of Setup.

<Tabs groupId="test-networks">
<TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $(cat .soroban/hello-id) \
  --source alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  hello \
  --to RPC
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local">

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $(cat .soroban/hello-id) \
  --source alice \
  --network local \
  -- \
  hello \
  --to RPC
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The following output should appear.

```json
["Hello", "RPC"]
```

:::info

The `--` double-dash is required!

This is a general [CLI pattern](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11376/what-does-double-dash-mean) used by other commands like [cargo run](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-run.html). Everything after the `--`, sometimes called [slop](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/971), is passed to a child process. In this case, `soroban contract invoke` builds an _implicit CLI_ on-the-fly for the `hello` method in your contract. It can do this because Soroban SDK embeds your contract's schema / interface types right in the `.wasm` file that gets deployed on-chain. You can also try:

```bash
soroban contract invoke ... -- --help
```

and

```bash
soroban contract invoke ... -- hello --help
```

## Summary

In this lesson, we learned how to:

- deploy a contract to a test network (either Testnet or a local network)
- interact with a deployed contract

You shouldn't have any changes to commit to git, because we didn't change any code in this lesson!

Next we'll add a new contract to this project, reorganizing the project as a multi-contract project using Cargo Workspaces. The new contract will show off a little bit of Soroban's storage capabilities.
