Once you've [Setup] your development environment, you're ready to create your
first Soroban contract.

[Setup]: setup.mdx

## 1. Create Rust library

Start by creating a new Rust library using the `cargo new` command.

```sh
cargo new --lib [project-name]
```

Open the `Cargo.toml`, it should look something like this:

```toml
[package]
name = "first-project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
```

## 2. Add soroban-sdk dependency

Add the following sections to the `Cargo.toml` that will import the `soroban-sdk`.

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[features]
default = ["export"]
export = []
testutils = ["soroban-sdk/testutils"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk", rev = "32b76650" }

[dev_dependencies]
first-project = { path = ".", features = ["testutils"] }
```

The features list and dev_dependencies might look a little strange, but we've
said that our contract can be built in three variations:
- By `default` with `export` with contract functions exported and available to
be called.
- Optionally without `export` enabled, contract functions not exported but types
exposed, which is useful when developing multiple contracts together.
- And when running tests with `testutils`, so that all the utilities that get
automatically generated for tests are available in the tests of your contract
and others that import it.

## 3. Write your first contract

Open the `src/lib.rs` file, and copy-paste the following code.

Run `cargo test` and watch the contract run.

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl Contract {
    pub fn hello(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        const GREETING: Symbol = Symbol::from_str("Hello");
        vec![&env, GREETING, to]
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
    mod test {
    use super::{Contract, hello};
    use soroban_sdk::{vec, Env, FixedBinary};

    #[test]
    fn test() {
        let env = Env::default();
        let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(&env, [0; 32]);
        env.register_contract(&contract_id, Contract);

        let words = hello::invoke(&env, &contract_id, &Symbol::from_str("Dev"));
        assert_eq!(
            words,
            vec![&env, Symbol::from_str("Hello"), Symbol::from_str("Dev"),]
        );
    }
}
```
