title: Restore archived contract data using the JavaScript SDK
hide_table_of_contents: true

This is a pretty likely occurrence: my piece of persistent data is archived because I haven't interacted with my contract in a while. How do I make it accessible again?

If you find that a piece of persistent data is archived, it can be restored using a Stellar transaction containing a `RestoreFootprintOp` operation. We'll make two assumptions for the sake of this guide:

- The contract instance itself is still live (i.e., others have been extending its TTL while you've been away).
- You don't know how your archived data is represented on the ledger.

The restoration process we'll use involves three discrete steps:

1. Simulate our transaction as we normally would.
2. If the simulation indicated it, we perform restoration with a `RestoreFootprintOp` operation using the hints we got from the simulation.
3. We retry running our initial transaction.

Here's a function called `submitOrRestoreAndRetry()` that will take care of all those steps for us:

This guide makes use of the (aptly named) `yeetTx` function we created in [another guide](../transactions/submit-transaction-wait-js.mdx).

```typescript
const RPC_SERVER = "https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org/";
const server = new SorobanRpc.Server(RPC_SERVER);

async function submitOrRestoreAndRetry(
  signer: Keypair,
  tx: Transaction,
): Promise<SorobanRpc.Api.GetTransactionResponse> {
  // We don't use `Server.prepareTransaction` here because we want to do
  // restoration if necessary, basically assembling the simulation ourselves.
  const server = new SorobanRpc.Server("https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org");
  const sim = await server.simulateTransaction(tx);

  // Other failures are out of scope of this tutorial.
  if (!SorobanRpc.Api.isSimulationSuccess(sim)) {
    throw sim;
  }

  // If simulation didn't fail, we don't need to restore anything! Just send it.
  if (!SorobanRpc.Api.isSimulationRestore(sim)) {
    const prepTx = SorobanRpc.assembleTransaction(tx, sim).build();
    prepTx.sign(signer);
    return yeetTx(prepTx);
  }

  // Build the restoration operation using the RPC server's hints.
  const account = await server.getAccount(signer.publicKey());
  let fee = parseInt(BASE_FEE);
  fee += parseInt(sim.restorePreamble.minResourceFee);

  const restoreTx = new TransactionBuilder(account, { fee: fee.toString() })
    .setNetworkPassphrase(Networks.TESTNET)
    .setSorobanData(sim.restorePreamble.transactionData.build())
    .addOperation(Operation.restoreFootprint({}))
    .build();

  restoreTx.sign(signer);

  const resp = await yeetTx(restoreTx);
  if (resp.status !== SorobanRpc.Api.GetTransactionStatus.SUCCESS) {
    throw resp;
  }

  // now that we've restored the necessary data, we can retry our tx using
  // the initial data from the simulation (which, hopefully, is still
  // up-to-date)
  const retryTxBuilder = TransactionBuilder.cloneFrom(tx, {
    fee: (parseInt(tx.fee) + parseInt(sim.minResourceFee)).toString(),
    sorobanData: sim.transactionData.build(),
  });
  // because we consumed a sequence number when restoring, we need to make sure
  // we set the correct value on this copy
  retryTxBuilder.source.incrementSequenceNumber();

  const retryTx = retryTxBuilder.build();
  retryTx.sign(signer);

  return yeetTx(retryTx);
}
```
