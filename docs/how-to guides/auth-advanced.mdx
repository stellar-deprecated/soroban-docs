title: Auth (Advanced)
---

The [advanced auth example] demonstrates how to write a contract that supports
multiple forms of authentication using the [soroban-auth] crate.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)][oigp]
[oigp]: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.4.2

The example supports authentication by:

- Being the invoker, as a transaction source account or a contract.
- Presigned invocations with account signers or ed25519 keys, similar to
  [EIP-2612] and [EIP-712] in the Ethereum ecosystem.

[EIP-2612]: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612
[EIP-712]: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712

:::info

If you're just starting to explore Soroban, checkout the [auth example] that
uses a simpler form of invoker auth.

:::

Participants are identified with `Identifier`s that can represent an:

- Account ID
- Contract ID
- Ed25519 key

:::tip

The `Identifier` type is a superset of the `Address` type used by the simpler
invoker-only auth. This means that contracts that store data using `Address` as
a key can often be updated to use `soroban-auth` without any impact to already
stored data. See the [auth example] more details.

:::

Participants specify how they are authenticating, and provide authentication by
including a `Signature` as an argument in the invocation. A `Signature` can be
an:

- Invoker – An invoking address (account ID or contract ID).
- Account – An invocation presigned with account signers.
- Ed25519 – An invocation presigned with an ed25519 key.

In this example, data is stored associated with an `Identifier` after
authorization has been verified. The contract supports auth via all methods
above.

:::info

This example describes a specific implementation of the general principles of
[authorization](../learn/authorization.mdx).

:::

:::caution

The [soroban-auth] crate does not provide any functionality to prevent the
replay of valid signatures. This example implements a form of [replay
prevention](#verifying-the-nonce). Contracts must implement replay prevention that
is appropriate for themselves.

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v0.4.2` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v0.4.2 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `auth_advanced` directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd auth_advanced
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 4 tests
test test::test_auth_with_invoker ... ok
test test::test_auth_with_ed25519 ... ok
thread 'test::test_auth_with_ed25519_wrong_signer' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: HostError
Value: Status(UnknownError(0))
...

Value: Status(ContractError(2))
...
test test::test_auth_with_ed25519_wrong_nonce - should panic ... ok
```

## Dependencies

The example uses the Soroban auth SDK, and has the following dependencies in its
`Cargo.toml` file.

```toml title="authorization/src/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "0.4.2"
soroban-auth = "0.4.2"

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "0.4.2", features = ["testutils"] }
soroban-auth = { version = "0.4.2", features = ["testutils"] }
```

## Code

```rust title="authorization/src/lib.rs"

pub enum DataKey {
    Counter(Identifier),
    Nonce(Identifier),
}

#[contracterror]
#[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
pub enum Error {
    IncorrectNonceForInvoker = 1,
    IncorrectNonce = 2,
}

pub struct IncrementContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl IncrementContract {
    /// Increment increments a counter for the invoker, and returns the value.
    pub fn increment(env: Env, sig: Signature, nonce: i128) -> u32 {
        // Verify that the signature signs and authorizes this invocation.
        let id = sig.identifier(&env);
        verify(&env, &sig, symbol!("increment"), (&id, &nonce));

        // Verify that the nonce has not been consumed to prevent replay of the
        // same presigned invocation more than once.
        verify_and_consume_nonce(&env, &sig, nonce);

        // Construct a key for the data being stored. Use an enum to set the
        // contract up well for adding other types of data to be stored.
        let key = DataKey::Counter(id);

        // Get the current count for the invoker.
        let mut count: u32 = env
            .storage()
            .get(&key)
            .unwrap_or(Ok(0)) // If no value set, assume 0.
            .unwrap(); // Panic if the value of COUNTER is not u32.

        // Increment the count.
        count += 1;

        // Save the count.
        env.storage().set(&key, count);

        // Return the count to the caller.
        count
    }

    pub fn nonce(env: Env, id: Identifier) -> i128 {
        get_nonce(&env, &id)
    }
}

fn verify_and_consume_nonce(env: &Env, sig: &Signature, nonce: i128) {
    match sig {
        Signature::Invoker => {
            if nonce != 0 {
                panic_with_error!(env, Error::IncorrectNonceForInvoker);
            }
        }
        Signature::Ed25519(_) | Signature::Account(_) => {
            let id = sig.identifier(env);
            if nonce != get_nonce(env, &id) {
                panic_with_error!(env, Error::IncorrectNonce);
            }

## How it Works

This example contract tracks a counter for each `Identifier`. It uses the
`soroban-auth` crate to verify proof of identity through a `Signature`. How a
signature is formed is different for different types of identifier.

### `soroban-auth`

Follow along in the docs for [soroban-auth].

#### Identifiers

The `soroban-auth` crate provides the `Identifier` type. Participants to be
authenticated are one of these.

```rust
pub enum Identifier {
    Account(AccountId),
    Contract(BytesN<32>),
    Ed25519(BytesN<32>),
}
```

The `Identifier` type is a superset of the `Address` type used by the simpler
invoker-only auth. This means that contracts that store data using `Address` as
a key can often be updated to use `soroban-auth` without any impact to already
stored data. See the [auth example] more details.

```rust
pub enum Address {
    Account(AccountId),
    Contract(BytesN<32>),
}
```

#### Signature

The `soroban-auth` crate provides the `Signature` type. Participants submit a
signature for the identifier they are proving.

```rust
pub enum Signature {
    Invoker,
    Account(AccountSignatures),
    Ed25519(Ed25519Signature),
}
```

`Signature` values map to `Identifier` values:

- Invoker
  - Account – Maps to `Identifier::Account`.
  - Contract – Maps to `Identifier::Contract`.
- Account – Maps to `Identifier::Account`.
- Ed25519 – Maps to `Identifier::Ed25519`.

##### Contract

A contract identifier provides authentication of itself simply by being the
invoker of the contract.

##### Ed25519

An ed25519 identifier provides a ed25519 signature using the private key
corresponding to the public key included in the signature. The signature payload
is the XDR serialized value of the `SignaturePayload` type.

```rust
pub struct Ed25519Signature {
    pub public_key: BytesN<32>,
    pub signature: BytesN<64>,
}
```

##### Account

An account identifier provides ed25519 signatures for each ed25519 signer of the
account. Verification works the same as verification of ed25519 signers on the
Stellar network. The total signing weight of the signers must exceed the medium
threshold of the account. The signature payload is the XDR serialized value of
the `SignaturePayload` type.

```rust
pub struct AccountSignatures {
    pub account_id: AccountId,
    pub signatures: Vec<Ed25519Signature>,
}
```

#### Signature Payload

The signature payload is the payload that ed25519 signers sign for both the
account and ed25519 signature types.

The `network`, `contract`, and `name` fields of the payload act as a domain
separator to prevent the signature for a set of arguments for the invocation of
one function or contract being valid for another function or contract.

The `name` field should be a value that sufficiently scopes where within a
contract the signature should be valid. In some cases it may be the name of the
function being invoked. It could be some other value depending on the needs of
the contract.

```rust
pub enum SignaturePayload {
    V0(SignaturePayloadV0),
}

pub struct SignaturePayloadV0 {
    pub network: Bytes,
    pub contract: BytesN<32>,
    pub name: Symbol,
    pub args: Vec<RawVal>,
}
```

### Contract

Open the `auth_advanced/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

#### Data

The example stores two types of data, and uses an enum to distinguish keys
for the two types of data scoped by an `Identifier`.

Each identifier will store a counter value, which is the value being incremented
by the invocation.

Each identifier will store a nonce value, which is the next expected nonce and
will be used for replay prevention.

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    Counter(Identifier),
    Nonce(Identifier),
}
```

#### Verify

The `increment` contract function increments a number for each `Identifier`
stored with key `DataKey::Counter`.

The `soroban_auth::verify` method verifies the input `Signature`.

```rust
pub fn increment(env: Env, sig: Signature, nonce: i128) -> u32 {
    let id = sig.identifier(&env);
    verify(&env, &sig, symbol!("increment"), (&id, &nonce));
    // ...
}
```

The function inputs are:

- `nonce` – Included in the arguments of the function to prevent replay.
- `sig` – The `Signature` that proves the `Identifier` it contains. The contract

The verification inputs are:

- `&sig` – The `Signature` to verify.
- `symbol!("increment")` – The scope of where the signature should be valid
  within this contract. In this example the scope is the name of this function.
- `&id` – The identifier the `Signature` signs approving the operation to
  increment that identifiers number.
- `&nonce` – The nonce to ensure the replay prevention value is included in the
  `SignaturePayload`.

#### Verifying the Nonce

The `increment` function verifies the nonce passed in and signed in the
`SignaturePayload` is the next expected nonce for the identifier.

:::caution

Whenever signatures are used to permit an operation, there is a risk of replay.
Replay occurs when a signature is used to permit an operation multiple times.
Such a situation can be catastrophic. For example, if you produce a signature
that permits $1 to be sent to an acquantaince and there is no replay prevention,
then a malicious acquantaince could use that signature to repeatedly transfer $1
from you to them. In the end, your account would be empty.

Contracts can provide replay prevention by numerous methods. One approach is by
including a sequential [nonce] as an argument in the `SignaturePayload` and
writing the contract such that it will not allow that nonce to be used more than
once. A sequential nonce is incremented on each use. The `SignaturePayload`
includes the nonce as a number. The contract stores the next expected nonce,
for each identifier. After verifying the signature, the contract loads the nonce
for the relevant identifier, checks that it matches the value in the signature,
and increments the value stored. This prevents reuse of the signature.

This example uses a sequential nonce for replay prevention.

[nonce]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce

:::

```rust
pub fn increment(env: Env, sig: Signature, nonce: i128) -> u32 {
    // ...
    verify_and_consume_nonce(&env, &sig, &nonce);
    // ...
}
```

When determining the next expected nonce the type of `Signature` is considered.

Invokers need no replay prevention. Invocations directly from an account in a
Stellar transaction get replay prevention from the Stellar transaction they are
submitted in, because Stellar transactions contain a sequence number that
operates like a nonce for the account. Contract invokers control when an
invocation occurs so also do not provide a nonce.

Presigned ed25519 signatures and account signatures get the stored nonce, verify
it matches the nonce included in this invocation, and error if not. The nonce is
incremented so that the value is consumed and cannot be reused.

```rust
fn verify_and_consume_nonce(env: &Env, sig: &Signature, nonce: i128) {
    match sig {
        Signature::Invoker => {
            if nonce != 0 {
                panic_with_error!(env, Error::IncorrectNonceForInvoker);
            }
        }
        Signature::Ed25519(_) | Signature::Account(_) => {
            let id = sig.identifier(env);
            if nonce != get_nonce(env, &id) {
                panic_with_error!(env, Error::IncorrectNonce);
            }
            set_nonce(env, &id, nonce + 1);
        }
    }
}

fn get_nonce(env: &Env, id: &Identifier) -> i128 {
    let key = DataKey::Nonce(id.clone());
    env.storage().get(key).unwrap_or(Ok(0)).unwrap()
}

fn set_nonce(env: &Env, id: &Identifier, nonce: i128) {
    let key = DataKey::Nonce(id.clone());
    env.storage().set(key, nonce);
}
```

:::info

If a contract function errors by returning an error or panicking with an error
or string, any operations the contract has performed such as emitting events or
storing data are rolled back. This also applies to incrementing of the nonce.
If a contract needs the nonce to be consumed on failed invocations, the contract
needs to be written so that an error is not returned and the invocation does not
fail.

:::

#### Storing Data Scoped by Identifier

The `increment` function stores the counter for each identifier using the
`DataKey::Counter` enum variant. If the contract evolves to store other data new
enum variants can be added for any new data items.

```rust
// Construct a key for the data being stored. Use an enum to set the
// contract up well for adding other types of data to be stored.
let key = DataKey::Counter(id);

// Get the current count for the invoker.
let mut count: u32 = env
    .storage()
    .get(&key)
    .unwrap_or(Ok(0)) // If no value set, assume 0.
    .unwrap(); // Panic if the value of COUNTER is not u32.

// Increment the count.
count += 1;

// Save the count.
env.storage().set(&key, count);
```

#### Retrieving the Nonce

Users of this contract will need to know which nonce to use. The contract could
expect users to keep track of the next nonce to use, but that may not be
trivial, so the contract exports a function that provides the information.

```rust
pub fn nonce(env: Env, id: Identifier) -> i128 {
    get_nonce(&env, &id)
}
```

### Tests

Open the `auth_advanced/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

#### Testing Auth by Invoker

The contract supports authentication with an invoker. The way this works is very
similar to the simpler [auth example].

```rust title="auth/src/test.rs"
#[test]
fn test_auth_with_invoker() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, IncrementContract);
    let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let user_1 = env.accounts().generate();
    let user_2 = env.accounts().generate();

    assert_eq!(
        client
            .with_source_account(&user_1)
            .increment(&Signature::Invoker, &0),
        1
    );
    // ...
}
```

The test generates account IDs for two users.

The `generate` function creates a new account ID that the test can use to
represent an account interacting with the contract.

```rust
let _ = env.accounts().generate();
```

The `increment` function is invoked with the users configured as the source
account and therefore the invoker. The invocation still requires a `Signature`
and `nonce` to be provided, but for an invoker in this example these values are
very simple.

```rust
client
    .with_source_account(&user_1)
    .increment(&Signature::Invoker, &0),
```

:::tip

Functions invoked in tests can use `with_source_account(account_id)` to simulate
an invocation from an account, and the invoked function will see `env.invoker()`
as `Address::Account(account_id)`.

:::

#### Testing Auth by Ed25519

The contract supports authentication with an ed25519 signature. This form of
auth can be useful for situations where a participant has no existence on
network.

```rust title="auth/src/test.rs"
#[test]
fn test_auth_with_ed25519() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = BytesN::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
    env.register_contract(&contract_id, IncrementContract);
    let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, contract_id.clone());

    let (user_1_id, user_1_sign) = soroban_auth::testutils::ed25519::generate(&env);
    let (user_2_id, user_2_sign) = soroban_auth::testutils::ed25519::generate(&env);

    let nonce = 0;
    let sig = soroban_auth::testutils::ed25519::sign(
        &env,
        &user_1_sign,
        &contract_id,
        symbol!("increment"),
        (&user_1_id, &nonce),
    );
    assert_eq!(client.increment(&sig, &nonce), 1);

    // ...
}
```

The test generates ed25519 keys and identifiers for two users.

The `generate` function creates a new random ed25519 key that the test can use
to produce signatures and verify to an identifier. The generate function
provides the identifier that the signer can sign for.

```rust
let (user_1_id, user_1_sign) = soroban_auth::testutils::ed25519::generate(&env);
```

The `sign` function produces a valid signature for the inputs. These inputs
should match the inputs that the `verify` function within the contract will
use.

```rust
let sig = soroban_auth::testutils::ed25519::sign(
    &env,
    &user_1_sign,
    &contract_id,
    symbol!("increment"),
    (&user_1_id, &nonce),
);
```

The `increment` function is invoked with the signature and the nonce.

```rust
client.increment(&sig, &nonce)
```

Open the `auth_advanced/src/test.rs` file to view other tests that demonstrate
how to test signature and nonce failure.

## Build the Contract

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

The `.wasm` file should be found in the `../target` directory after building:

```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_advanced_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke functions on the contract.

:::caution

The [`soroban-cli`] is in development and passing enum and struct values as
inputs requires typing their raw JSON representation. Improvements are planned.

:::

To invoke the contract as an account invoker the `Signature` to be passed must
be a single-element `Vec` containing the `Symbol` `"Invoker"`.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_advanced_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --account GC24I42QMKKR4NE6IYNPCQHUO4PXWXDGNZ7QVMMSR5EWAYSGKBHPLGHH \
    --fn increment \
    --arg '{"object":{"vec":[{"symbol":[73,110,118,111,107,101,114]}]}}' \
    --arg 0
```

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_auth_advanced_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --account GC24I42QMKKR4NE6IYNPCQHUO4PXWXDGNZ7QVMMSR5EWAYSGKBHPLGHH \
    --fn increment \
    --arg '{"object":{"vec":[{"symbol":[73,110,118,111,107,101,114]}]}}' \
    --arg 0
```

Run these commands several times to increment the counters for each account.

View the data that has been stored against each user with `soroban read`.

```sh
soroban read --id 1
```

```
