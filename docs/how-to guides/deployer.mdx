:::info

In this example there are two contracts that are compiled separately, and the
tests deploy one with the other.

[deployer example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.4.2/deployer

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v0.4.2` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v0.4.2 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `deployer/deployer`
directory, and use `cargo test`.

```
cd deployer/deployer
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="deployer/deployer/src/lib.rs"
pub struct Deployer;

#[contractimpl]
impl Deployer {
    /// Deploy the contract using WASM hash and after deployment invoke the init
    /// function of the contract with the given arguments. Returns the
    /// contract ID and result of the init function.
    pub fn deploy(
        env: Env,
        salt: Bytes,
        wasm_hash: BytesN<32>,
        init_fn: Symbol,
        init_args: Vec<RawVal>,
    ) -> (BytesN<32>, RawVal) {
        // Deploy the contract using the installed WASM code with given hash.
        let id = env.deployer().with_current_contract(salt).deploy(wasm_hash);
        // Invoke the init function with the given arguments.
        let res: RawVal = env.invoke_contract(&id, &init_fn, init_args);
        // Return the contract ID of the deployed contract and the result of
        // invoking the init result.
        (id, res)
    }
}
```

## How it Works

Contracts can deploy other contracts by using the SDK.

The contract ID of the deployed contract is deterministic and is derived from
the deploying contract ID and the provided salt.

Open the `deployer/deployer/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

### Contract Code Installation

Before deploying the new contract instances, the WASM code needs to be installed
on-chain. Then it can be used to deploy an arbitrary number of contract
instances. The installation should typically happen outside of the deployer
contract, as it needs to happen just once.
while the deployer contract can be called multiple times.

See the [tests](#tests) for an example of installing the contract code in tests.
For the actual on-chain installation see the general deployment
[tutorial](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-futurenet).

### Deployer

The `Deployer` contract deploys other contracts. It accepts a salt that will be
used to derive a contract ID and a hash-based identifier of the installed WASM
(note, that this is not just the hash of the WASM file).
It also accepts an initialization function and arguments to pass to that function.

The contract first gets a deployer using the salt, then calls deploy with the
WASM hash. The contract ID for the new contract is returned. The implementation
of the new contract is defined by the WASM file installed under `wasm_hash` (
only the `wasm_hash` itself is stored per contract ID thus saving the ledger
space and fees).

The contract ID is deterministic and is derived from the deploying contract and
the salt.

```rust
let id = env.deployer().with_current_contract(salt).deploy(wasm_hash);
```

The contract invokes the new contract's initialization function and passes
through the arguments.

```rust
let res: RawVal = env.invoke_contract(&id, &init_fn, init_args);
```

The contract returns the new contract ID and the result of the initialization
function.

```rust
(id, res)
```

### Tests

Open the `deployer/deployer/src/test.rs` file to follow along.

```rust title="deployer/deployer/src/test.rs"
// The contract that will be deployed by the deployer contract.
mod contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file = "../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm"
    );
}

#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let client = DeployerClient::new(&env, &env.register_contract(None, Deployer));

    // Install the WASM that will be deployed by the deployer contract.
    let wasm_hash = env.install_contract_wasm(contract::WASM);

    // Deploy contract using deployer, and include an init function to call.
    let salt = Bytes::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
    let init_fn = symbol!("init");
    let init_fn_args = (5u32,).into_val(&env);
    let (contract_id, init_result) = client.deploy(&salt, &wasm_hash, &init_fn, &init_fn_args);
    assert!(init_result.is_void());

    // Invoke contract to check that it is initialized.
    let client = contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
    let sum = client.value();
    assert_eq!(sum, 5);
}
```

The test imports a test contract from the `soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm`
file.

```rust
mod contract {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file = "../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm"
    );
}
```

That contract contains the following code, which exports a couple
functions that sets a value in the initialization function and allows the value
to be retrieved from another function.

```rust title="deployer/contract/src/lib.rs"
pub struct Contract;

const KEY: Symbol = symbol!("value");

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    pub fn init(env: Env, value: u32) {
        env.storage().set(KEY, value);
    }
    pub fn value(env: Env) -> u32 {
        env.storage().get_unchecked(KEY).unwrap()
    }
}
```

The test contract will be used when testing the deployer. The deployer contract
deploys the test contract and invokes its `init` function.

In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`, which is the
Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

Install the code of the test contract that we have imported above via
`contractimport!` and get the hash of the installed WASM code:

```rust
// Install the WASM that will be deployed by the deployer contract.
let wasm_hash = env.install_contract_wasm(contract::WASM);
```

Register the deployer contract with the environment.

```rust
env.register_contract(&deployer_id, Deployer);
```

Create a client to invoke the `Deployer` contract.

```rust
let client = DeployerClient::new(&env, &deployer_id);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a
generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract
type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is
`Deployer`, and the client is named `DeployerClient`.

The client is used to invoke the `deploy` function. The contract will deploy the
test contract using the hash of its WASM code, call the `"init"` function, and
pass in a single `5u32` argument.

```rust
// Deploy contract using deployer, and include an init function to call.
let salt = Bytes::from_array(&env, &[0; 32]);
let init_fn = symbol!("init");
let init_fn_args = (5u32,).into_val(&env);
let (contract_id, init_result) = client.deploy(&salt, &wasm_hash, &init_fn, &init_fn_args);
assert!(init_result.is_void());
```

The test checks that the test contract was deployed by using its client to
invoke it and get back the value set during initialization.

```rust
let client = contract::Client::new(&env, &contract_id);
let sum = client.value();
assert_eq!(sum, 5);
```

## Build the Contracts

To build the contract into a `.wasm` file, use the `cargo build` command. Build
both the deployer contract and the test contract.

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Both `.wasm` files should be found in the `../target` directory after building
both contracts:

```
../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_contract.wasm
```

```
../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke the contract function to
deploy the test contract.

Before deploying the test contract with the deployer, install the test contract
WASM using the `install` command. The `install` command will print out the
hash derived from the WASM file (it's not just the hash of the WASM file itself
though) which should be used by the deployer.

```sh
soroban install --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_test_contract.wasm
```

The command prints out the hash as hex. It will look something like `edce149b183ea03dfd896a263d2e17c1f08229da52afa6f822d9cbc67c103806`.

Then the deployer contract may be invoked with the WASM hash value above.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_deployer_contract.wasm \
    --id 0 \
    --fn deploy \
    --arg 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \
    --arg edce149b183ea03dfd896a263d2e17c1f08229da52afa6f822d9cbc67c103806 \
    --arg init \
    --arg '[{"u32":5}]'
```

And then invoke the deployed test contract using the identifier returned from
the previous command.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --id ead19f55aec09bfcb555e09f230149ba7f72744a5fd639804ce1e934e8fe9c5d \
    --fn value
```

The following output should occur using the code above.

```json
5
```
