title: Atomic Swap
description: Swapping tokens and using the auth framework.
---

The [atomic swap example] swaps two tokens between two authorized parties 
atomically while following the limits they set.

This is example demonstrates advanced usage of Soroban auth framework and
assumes the reader is familiar with the [auth example](auth.mdx) and with
Soroban token usage.

[atomic swap example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.7.0/atomic_swap

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v0.7.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v0.7.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example use `cargo test`.

```
cargo test -p soroban-atomic-swap-contract
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test_atomic_swap ... ok
```

## Code

```rust title="atomic_swap/src/lib.rs"
mod token {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(file = "../soroban_token_spec.wasm");
}

pub struct AtomicSwapContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl AtomicSwapContract {
    // Swap token A for token B atomically. Settle for the minimum requested price
    // for each party (this is an arbitrary choice to demonstrate the usage of
    // allowance; full amounts could be swapped as well).
    pub fn swap(
        env: Env,
        a: Address,
        b: Address,
        token_a: BytesN<32>,
        token_b: BytesN<32>,
        amount_a: i128,
        min_b_for_a: i128,
        amount_b: i128,
        min_a_for_b: i128,
    ) {
        // Verify preconditions on the minimum price for both parties.
        if amount_b < min_b_for_a {
            panic!("not enough token B for token A");
        }
        if amount_a < min_a_for_b {
            panic!("not enough token A for token B");
        }
        // Require authorization for a subset of arguments specific to a party.
        // Notice, that arguments are symmetric - there is no difference between
        // `a` and `b` in the call and hence their signatures can be used
        // either for `a` or for `b` role.
        a.require_auth_for_args(
            (token_a.clone(), token_b.clone(), amount_a, min_b_for_a).into_val(&env),
        );
        b.require_auth_for_args(
            (token_b.clone(), token_a.clone(), amount_b, min_a_for_b).into_val(&env),
        );

        // Perform the swap via two token transfers.
        move_token(&env, token_a, &a, &b, amount_a, min_a_for_b);
        move_token(&env, token_b, &b, &a, amount_b, min_b_for_a);
    }
}

fn move_token(
    env: &Env,
    token: BytesN<32>,
    from: &Address,
    to: &Address,
    approve_amount: i128,
    xfer_amount: i128,
) {
    let token = token::Client::new(&env, &token);
    let contract_address = env.current_contract_address();
    // This call needs to be authorized by `from` address. Since it increases
    // the allowance on behalf of the contract, `from` doesn't need to know `to`
    // at the signature time.
    token.incr_allow(&from, &contract_address, &approve_amount);
    token.xfer_from(&contract_address, &from, to, &xfer_amount);
}
```

## How it Works

The example contract requires two `Address`-es to authorize their parts of the
swap operation: one `Address` wants to sell a given amount of token A for
token B at a given price and another `Address` wants to sell token B for token
A at a given price. The contract swaps the tokens atomically, but only if the
requested minimum price is respected for both parties.

Open the `atomic_swap/src/lib.rs` file or see the code above to follow along.

### Swap authorization

```rust
...
a.require_auth_for_args(
    (token_a.clone(), token_b.clone(), amount_a, min_b_for_a).into_val(&env),
);
b.require_auth_for_args(
    (token_b.clone(), token_a.clone(), amount_b, min_a_for_b).into_val(&env),
);
...
```

Authorization of `swap` function leverages `require_auth_for_args` Soroban host
function. Both `a` and `b` need to authorize symmetric arguments: token they
sell, token they buy, amount of token they sell, minimum amount of token they
want to receive. This means that `a` and `b` can be freely exchanged in the
invocation arguments (as long as the respective arguments are changed too).

### Moving the tokens

```rust
...
// Perform the swap via two token transfers.
move_token(&env, token_a, &a, &b, amount_a, min_a_for_b);
move_token(&env, token_b, &b, &a, amount_b, min_b_for_a);
...
fn move_token(
    env: &Env,
    token: BytesN<32>,
    from: &Address,
    to: &Address,
    approve_amount: i128,
    xfer_amount: i128,
) {
    let token = token::Client::new(&env, &token);
    let contract_address = env.current_contract_address();
    // This call needs to be authorized by `from` address. Since it increases
    // the allowance on behalf of the contract, `from` doesn't need to know `to`
    // at the signature time.
    token.incr_allow(&from, &contract_address, &approve_amount);
    token.xfer_from(&contract_address, &from, to, &xfer_amount);
}
```

The swap itself is implemented via two token moves: from `a` to `b` and from `b`
to `a`. The token move is implemented via allowance: the users don't need to
know each other in order to perform the swap, and instead they authorize the swap
contract to spend the necessary amount of token on their behalf via
`incr_allow`. Soroban auth framework makes sure that the `incr_allow` signatures
would have the proper context, and they won't be usable outside the `swap`
contract invocation.

### Tests

Open the [`atomic_swap/src/test.rs`] file to follow along.

[`atomic_swap/src/test.rs`]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.7.0/atomic_swap/src/test.rs

Refer to another examples for the general information on the test setup.

The interesting part for this example is verification of `swap` authorization:

```rust
contract.swap(
    &a,
    &b,
    &token_a.contract_id,
    &token_b.contract_id,
    &1000,
    &4500,
    &5000,
    &950,
);

assert_eq!(
    env.recorded_top_authorizations(),
    std::vec![
        (
            a.clone(),
            contract.contract_id.clone(),
            Symbol::short("swap"),
            (
                token_a.contract_id.clone(),
                token_b.contract_id.clone(),
                1000_i128,
                4500_i128
            )
                .into_val(&env),
        ),
        (
            b.clone(),
            contract.contract_id.clone(),
            Symbol::short("swap"),
            (
                token_b.contract_id.clone(),
                token_a.contract_id.clone(),
                5000_i128,
                950_i128
            )
                .into_val(&env),
        ),
    ]
);
```

`env.recorded_top_authorizations()` returns all the top-level authorizations.
Hence, in the case of `swap` two authorizations are expected. Note, that the
element order here matches the order of `require_auth_for_args` calls in the
contract.
