title: Custom Account
description: Accounts that support multisig and custom auth policies.
---

The [custom account example] demonstrates how to implement a simple account
contract that supports multisig and customizable authorization policies. This
account contract can be used with the Soroban auth framework, so that any time
an `Address` pointing at this contract instance is used, the custom logic
implemented here is applied.

The custom accounts are exclusive to Soroban and can't be used to perform the
regular Stellar operations.

Implementing a proper custom account contract requires a very good
understanding of authentication and authorization and requires rigorous
testing and review. The example here is *not* a full-fledged account contract -
use it as an API reference only.

:::caution

Custom Accounts are still experimental and there is not much tooling built
around them yet beyond the Soroban SDK support.

[custom account example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.6.0/account

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v0.6.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v0.6.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example use `cargo test`.

```
cargo test -p soroban-account-contract
```

You should see the output:

```
running 1 test
test test::test_token_auth ... ok
```

## How it Works

Open the `account/src/lib.rs` file to follow along.

Any account contract has to implement a special function `__check_auth` that 
takes the signature payload, signatures and authorization context.

The example contract here uses `ed25519` keys for signature verification and
supports multiple unweighted signers. It also implements a policy that allows
setting per-token limits on transfers. The token can be spent beyond the limit
only if every signature is provided. 

For example, the user may initialize this contract with 2 keys and introduce 100
USDC spend limit. This way they can use a single key to sign their contract
invocations and be sure that even if they sign a malicious transaction they 
won't lose more than 100 USDC.

### Initialization

```rust
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone)]
enum DataKey {
    SignerCnt,
    Signer(BytesN<32>),
    SpendLimit(BytesN<32>),
}
...
// Initialize the contract with a list of ed25519 public key ('signers').
pub fn init(env: Env, signers: Vec<BytesN<32>>) {
    // In reality this would need some additional validation on signers
    // (deduplication etc.).
    for signer in signers.iter() {
        env.storage().set(&DataKey::Signer(signer.unwrap()), &());
    }
    env.storage().set(&DataKey::SignerCnt, &signers.len());
}
```

Account contracts are the few contracts that need to work with the public keys
explicitly and not the `Address` type. Here we initialize the contract with
ed25519 keys.

### Policy modification

```rust
// Adds a limit on any token transfers that aren't signed by every signer.
pub fn add_limit(env: Env, token: BytesN<32>, limit: i128) {
    // The current contract address is the account contract address and has
    // the same semantics for `require_auth` call as any other account
    // contract address.
    // Note, that if a contract *invokes* another contract, then it would
    // authorize the call on its own behalf and that wouldn't require any
    // user-side verification.
    env.current_contract_address().require_auth();
    env.storage().set(&DataKey::SpendLimit(token), &limit);
}
```

This function allows users to set and modify the per-token spend limit described
above. The neat trick here is that `require_auth` can be used for the 
`current_contract_address()`, i.e. the account contract may be used to verify
authorization for its own administrative functions. This way there is no need
to write duplicate authorization and authentication logic.

### `__check_auth`

```rust
pub fn __check_auth(
    env: Env,
    signature_payload: BytesN<32>,
    signatures: Vec<Signature>,
    auth_context: Vec<AuthorizationContext>,
) -> Result<(), AccError> {
    // Perform authentication.
    authenticate(&env, &signature_payload, &signatures)?;

    let tot_signers: u32 = env.storage().get(&DataKey::SignerCnt).unwrap().unwrap();
    let all_signed = tot_signers == signatures.len();

    let curr_contract_id = env.current_contract_id();

    // This is a map for tracking the token spend limits per token. This
    // makes sure that if e.g. multiple `xfer` calls are being authorized
    // for the same token we still respect the limit for the total
    // transferred amount (and not the 'per-call' limits).
    let mut spend_left_per_token = Map::<BytesN<32>, i128>::new(&env);
    // Verify the authorization policy.
    for context in auth_context.iter() {
        verify_authorization_policy(
            &env,
            &context.unwrap(),
            &curr_contract_id,
            all_signed,
            &mut spend_left_per_token,
        )?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

`__check_auth` is a special function that turns a contract into an 'account
contract'. It will get called by the Soroban host every time 
`require_auth/require_auth_for_args` is called for the address of this contract.

Here it is implemented in two steps. First, authentication is performed using
the signature payload and a vector of signatures. Second, authorization policy
is enforced using the `auth_context` vector. This vector contains all the
contract calls that are being authorized by the provided signatures.

`__check_auth` is a reserved function and can only be called by the Soroban
host as a callback from `require_auth` host function. All the direct calls to
 `__check_auth` will fail. This makes it safe to write to the account contract
 storage from `__check_auth`, as it's guaranteed to not be called in unexpected
 context (so it's possible to e.g. persist the spend limits without worrying
 that they'll be exhausted via just calling `__check_auth` directly).

### Authentication

```rust
fn authenticate(
    env: &Env,
    signature_payload: &BytesN<32>,
    signatures: &Vec<Signature>,
) -> Result<(), AccError> {
    for i in 0..signatures.len() {
        let signature = signatures.get_unchecked(i).unwrap();
        if i > 0 {
            let prev_signature = signatures.get_unchecked(i - 1).unwrap();
            if prev_signature.public_key >= signature.public_key {
                return Err(AccError::BadSignatureOrder);
            }
        }
        if !env
            .storage()
            .has(&DataKey::Signer(signature.public_key.clone()))
        {
            return Err(AccError::UnknownSigner);
        }
        env.crypto().ed25519_verify(
            &signature.public_key,
            &signature_payload.clone().into(),
            &signature.signature,
        );
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Authentication here simply checks that the provided signatures are valid given
the payload and also that they belong to the signers of this account contract.

### Authorization policy

```rust
fn verify_authorization_policy(
    env: &Env,
    context: &AuthorizationContext,
    curr_contract_id: &BytesN<32>,
    all_signed: bool,
    spend_left_per_token: &mut Map<BytesN<32>, i128>,
) -> Result<(), AccError> {
    // For the account control every signer must sign the invocation.
    if &context.contract == curr_contract_id {
        if !all_signed {
            return Err(AccError::NotEnoughSigners);
        }
    }
```

We verify the policy per `AuthorizationContext` i.e. per one `require_auth` 
call. 
The policy for the account contract itself enforces every signer to have signed
the method call.

```rust
// Otherwise, we're only interested in functions that spend tokens.
if context.fn_name != XFER_FN && context.fn_name != INCR_ALLOW_FN {
    return Ok(());
}

let spend_left: Option<i128> =
    if let Some(spend_left) = spend_left_per_token.get(context.contract.clone()) {
        Some(spend_left.unwrap())
    } else if let Some(limit_left) = env
        .storage()
        .get(&DataKey::SpendLimit(context.contract.clone()))
    {
        Some(limit_left.unwrap())
    } else {
        None
    };

// 'None' means that the contract is outside of the policy.
if let Some(spend_left) = spend_left {
    // 'amount' is the third argument in both `approve` and `xfer`.
    // If the contract has a different signature, it's safer to panic
    // here, as it's expected to have the standard interface.
    let spent: i128 = context
        .args
        .get(2)
        .unwrap()
        .unwrap()
        .try_into_val(env)
        .unwrap();
    if spent < 0 {
        return Err(AccError::NegativeAmount);
    }
    if !all_signed && spent > spend_left {
        return Err(AccError::NotEnoughSigners);
    }
    spend_left_per_token.set(context.contract.clone(), spend_left - spent);
}
Ok(())
```

Then we check for the standard token function names and verify that for these
function we don't exceed the spending limits.

### Tests

Open the [`account/src/test.rs`] file to follow along.

[`account/src/test.rs`]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.6.0/account/src/test.rs

Refer to another examples for the general information on the test setup.

Here we only look at some points specific to the account contracts.

```rust
fn sign(e: &Env, signer: &Keypair, payload: &BytesN<32>) -> RawVal {
    Signature {
        public_key: signer_public_key(e, signer),
        signature: signer
            .sign(payload.to_array().as_slice())
            .to_bytes()
            .into_val(e),
    }
    .into_val(e)
}
```

Unlike most of the contracts that may simply use `Address`, account contracts
deal with the signature verification and hence need to actually sign the
payloads.

```rust
let payload = BytesN::random(&env);
let token = BytesN::random(&env);
env.invoke_account_contract_check_auth::<AccError>(
    &account_contract.contract_id,
    &payload,
    &vec![&env, sign(&env, &signers[0], &payload)],
    &vec![
        &env,
        token_auth_context(&env, &token, Symbol::new(&env, "xfer"), 1000),
    ],
)
.unwrap();
```

`__check_auth` can't be called directly as regular contract functions, hence we
need to use `invoke_account_contract_check_auth` testing utility that emulates
being called by the Soroban host during a `require_auth` call.

```rust
let account_address = Address::from_contract_id(&env, &account_contract.contract_id);
// Add a spend limit of 1000 per 1 signer.
account_contract.add_limit(&token, &1000);
// Verify that this call needs to be authorized.
assert_eq!(
    env.recorded_top_authorizations(),
    std::vec![(
        account_address.clone(),
        account_contract.contract_id.clone(),
        Symbol::short("add_limit"),
        (token.clone(), 1000_i128).into_val(&env),
    )]
);
```
`env.recorded_top_authorizations()` can still be used for the functions that
aren't `__check_auth` and use the regular Soroban auth. As it usually happens
in tests, authorizations are just recorded and `__check_auth` is not actually
called.

```rust
assert_eq!(
    env.invoke_account_contract_check_auth::<AccError>(
        &account_contract.contract_id,
        &payload,
        &vec![&env, sign(&env, &signers[0], &payload)],
        &vec![
            &env,
            token_auth_context(&env, &token, Symbol::new(&env, "xfer"), 1001)
        ],
    )
    .err()
    .unwrap()
    .unwrap(),
    AccError::NotEnoughSigners
);
```  
Passing the contract-specific error to `invoke_account_contract_check_auth`
allows verifying the exact error code and makes sure that the verification has
failed due to not having enough signers and not for any other reason. 

It's a good idea for the account contract to have detailed error codes and
verify that they are returned when they are expected.
