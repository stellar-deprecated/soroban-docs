title: Batched Atomic Swaps
description: Swapping tokens between two groups of users.
---

The [atomic swap batching example] swaps a pair of tokens between the two groups of users that authorized the `swap` operation from the [Atomic Swap] example.

This contract basically batches the multiple swaps while following some simple rules to match the swap participants.

Follow the comments in the code for more information.
