title: Migrating Auth to SDK 0.6.0
description: Migrating auth code for contracts written prior to SDK 0.6.0.
---

This is a guide about migrating authorization code in contracts written before SDK 0.6.0 to the new version of auth (Soroban authorization framework).

For general information on authorization in Soroban see the [authorization overview](../learn/authorization.mdx) and the [example](auth.mdx).

## Migrating `env.invoker()`

The simplest authorization approach previously was to use `env.invoker()`. This concept is no longer present in Soroban SDK or host (it is available at the transaction building time though, [details]).

[details]: invoking-contracts-with-transactions.mdx#authorization-data

In order to migrate a contract that uses `env.invoker()` do the following:

1. Add an `Address` argument to the function signature, for example, `addr: Address`. This is the authorized entity that we will use instead of invoker.
1. Call `addr.require_auth()` at the top of the function code to ensure that the address has authorized the function call.
1. Replace all the instances of `env.invoker()` with `addr`.

A small example of migration:

Before:

```rust
struct MyContract;
impl MyContract {
    fn set_val(env: Env, val: i128) {
        env.storage().set(&env.invoker(), &val);
    }
}
```

After:

```rust
struct MyContract;
impl MyContract {
    fn set_val(env: Env, addr: Address, val: i128) {
        addr.require_auth();
        env.storage().set(&addr, &val);
    }
}
```

A more detailed example can be found in the Soroban timelock example migration [PR][timelock-pr].

## Migrating `soroban-auth`

For more advanced auth use cases the `soroban-auth` library could be used. In order to migrate from this library to Soroban authorization framework do the following steps:

1. Change the type of all the `Identifier` variables to `Address`.
1. Change the type of all the `Signature` types to `Address`.
1. Replace signature verification code with a call of `require_auth`/`require_auth_for_args` for the respective `Address` that has been represented by a `Signature` before.
1. Remove nonces and nonce-related code as the replay protection is already ensured by the Soroban host.

An example of `soroban-auth` migration can be found in the Soroban token example migration [PR][token-pr].
