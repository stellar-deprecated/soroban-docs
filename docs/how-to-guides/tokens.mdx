import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The [token example] demonstrates how to write a token contract that implements
the [token interface].

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)][oigp]

[oigp]: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.8.4
[token example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.8.4/token
[token interface]: ../reference/interfaces/token-interface.mdx

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment
configured, then clone the `v0.8.4` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

```bash
git clone -b v0.8.4 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in
[Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example, navigate to the `hello_world` directory, and
use `cargo test`.

```bash
cd token
cargo test
```

You should see the output:

```bash
running 8 tests
test test::initialize_already_initialized - should panic ... ok
test test::transfer_spend_deauthorized - should panic ... ok
test test::decimal_is_over_max - should panic ... ok
test test::test_burn ... ok
test test::transfer_receive_deauthorized - should panic ... ok
test test::transfer_from_insufficient_allowance - should panic ... ok
test test::transfer_insufficient_balance - should panic ... ok
test test::test ... ok
```

## Code

{/*
TODO: Is this the best way to present the source code here? I've put each of
the files into its own "tab" within the markdown, and code blocks are within
each of those tabs. Are they all needed here? Should we just cram them into one
code block (that seems like a pretty obvious no to me, lol)?

Docusaurus does seem to be _pretty_ picky about whitespace if you want to
include code blocks within the tabs, so maybe maintainability of this document
is something to consider here?

## How it Works

Tokens created on a smart contract platform can take many different forms,
include a variety of different functionality, and meet very different needs or
use-cases. While each token can fulfill a unique niche, there are some "normal"
features that almost all tokens will need to make use of (e.g., payments,
transfers, balance queries, etc.). In an effort to minimize repetition and
streamline token deployments, Soroban implements the [Stellar Asset Contract]
which provides a uniform, predictable interface for developers and users.

This example contract demonstrates how a smart contract token might be
constructed that doesn't take advantage of the Stellar Asset Contract, but does
satisfy the commonly used [token interface] to maximize interoperability.

[Stellar Asset Contract]: stellar-asset-contract.mdx

{/* TODO: Flesh out the following "main concept" sections a bit more */}

### Separation of Functionality

You have likely noticed that this example contract is broken into discrete
modules, with each one responsible for a siloed set of functionality. This
common practice helps to organize the code and make it more maintainable.

For example, the bulk of the token logic exists in the `contract.rs` module.
Functions like `mint`, `burn`, `transfer`, etc. are written and programmed in
that file. The token interface describes how some of these functions should emit
events when they occur. However, keeping all that event-emitting logic bundled
in with the rest of the contract code could make it harder to track what is
happening in the code, and that confusion could ultimately lead to errors.

Instead, we have a separate `events.rs` module that takes away all the headache
of emitting events when other functions run. Here is the function to emit an
event whenever the token is minted:

```rust
pub(crate) fn mint(e: &Env, admin: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) {
    let topics = (Symbol::short("mint"), admin, to);
    e.events().publish(topics, amount);
}
```

Admittedly, this is a simple example, but constructing the contract this way
makes it very clear to the developer what is happening and where. This function
is then used by the `contract.rs` module whenever the `mint` function is
invoked:

```rust
// earlier in `contract.rs`
use crate::event;

fn mint(e: Env, to: Address, amount: i128) {
    check_nonnegative_amount(amount);
    let admin = read_administrator(&e);
    admin.require_auth();
    receive_balance(&e, to.clone(), amount);
    // highlight-next-line
    event::mint(&e, admin, to, amount);
}
```

This same convention is used to separate from the "main" contract code the
metadata for the token, the storage type definitions, etc.

### Standardized Interface, Customized Behavior

This example contract follows the standardized token interface, implementing all
of the same functions as the Stellar Asset Contract. This gives wallets, users,
developers, etc. a predictable interface to interact with the token. Even though
we are implementing the same _interface_ of functions, that doesn't mean we have
to implement the same _behavior_ inside those functions. While this example
contract doesn't actually modify any of the functions, that possibility remains
open to the contract developer.

By way of example, perhaps you have an NFT project, and the artist wants to have
a small royalty paid every time their token transfers hands:

```rust
// This is mainly the `transfer` function from `src/contract.rs`
fn transfer(e: Env, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) {
    from.require_auth();

    check_nonnegative_amount(amount);
    spend_balance(&e, from.clone(), amount);
    // highlight-start
    // We calculate some new amounts for payment and royalty
    let payment = (amount * 997) / 1000;
    let royalty = amount - payment
    receive_balance(&e, artist.clone(), royalty);
    // highlight-end
    receive_balance(&e, to.clone(), payment);
    event::transfer(&e, from, to, amount);
}
```

The `transfer` interface is still in use, and is still the same as other tokens,
but we've customized the behavior to address a specific need. Another use-case
might be a tightly controlled token that requires authentication from an admin
before any `transfer`, `allowance`, etc. function could be invoked.

:::tip

Of course, you will want your token to behave in an _intuitive_ and
_transparent_ manner. If a user is invoking a `transfer`, they will expect
tokens to move. If an asset issuer needs to invoke a `clawback` they will likely
_require_ the right kind of behavior to take place.

:::

### Compatible with Classic Stellar Assets

We should describe how this can be useful for assets that are already issued
on Stellar, as well as capable of all the same asset control tools that already
exist baked-in at the protocol level (clawbacks, auth_required, etc.)

The token example implements eight different tests, to cover a wide array of
potential behavior and problems. However, all of the tests start with a few
common pieces. In any test the first thing that is always required is an `Env`,
which is the Soroban environment that the contract will run in.

```rust
let e = Env::default();
```

{/* TODO: Fact-check me here please. I'm not sure I've described this accurately */}

We mock authentication checks in the tests, which allows the tests to proceed as
if all users/addresses/contracts/etc. had successfully authenticated.

```rust
e.mock_all_auths();
```

{/* /TODO */}

We're also using a `create_token` function to ease the repetition of having to
register and initialize our token contract. The resulting `token` client is then
used to invoke the contract during each test.

```rust
// It is defined at the top of the file...
fn create_token<'a>(e: &Env, admin: &Address) -> TokenClient<'a> {
    let token = TokenClient::new(e, &e.register_contract(None, Token {}));
    token.initialize(admin, &7, &"name".into_val(e), &"symbol".into_val(e));
    token
}

// ... and it is used inside each test
let token = create_token(&e, &admin);
```

All public functions within an `impl` block that is annotated with the
`#[contractimpl]` attribute have a corresponding function generated in a
generated client type. The client type will be named the same as the contract
type with `Client` appended. For example, in our contract the contract type is
`Token`, and the client is named `TokenClient`.

The eight tests created for this example contract test a range of possible conditions,
and ensure the contract responds appropriately to each one:

{/* TODO: Include more (any?) details about what each test is checking for */}

- The `test()` function...
- The `test_burn()` function...
- The `transfer_insufficient_balance()` function...
- The `transfer_receive_deauthorized()` function...
- The `transfer_spend_deauthorized()` function...
- The `transfer_from_insufficient_allowance()` function...
- The `initialize_already_initialized()` function...
- The `decimal_is_over_max()` function...

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, use the `cargo build` command.

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

A `.wasm` file should be outputted in the `target` directory:

```bash
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_token_contract.wasm
```

## Run the Contract

If you have [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can invoke contract functions using
it.

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_token_contract.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    -- \
    balance \
    --id GBZV3NONYSUDVTEHATQO4BCJVFXJO3XQU5K32X3XREVZKSMMOZFO4ZXR
```
