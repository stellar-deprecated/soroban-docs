title: Writing Code Metadata in WASM
description: A macro that allows you to write structured metadata into the WASM custom section.
---

The
[contractmeta!](https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk/0.8.3/soroban_sdk/macro.contractmeta.html)
macro provided in the Rust SDK allows users to write two strings - a `key` and a
`val` - within a serialized `SCMetaEntry::SCMetaV0` XDR object to the custom
section of WASM contracts. The section name for this metadata is
`contractmetav0`. Developers can utilize this macro to write metadata, and tools
can then read and display this information to users.

The [liquidity pool example](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/blob/v0.8.1/liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs#L152) provides a clear demonstration of how to use the `contractmeta!` macro:

```rust

// Metadata that is added on to the WASM custom section
contractmeta!(
    key = "Description",
    val = "Constant product AMM with a .3% swap fee"
);

pub trait LiquidityPoolTrait {...
```
