title: Interacting with contracts

## Three types of interactions

### Function call

A function call is the simplest and least expensive kind of contract
interaction. A function call does exactly what you would expect a contract call
to do in any other software development context: the contract transfers control
and data to another part of the _same_ contract. Because a function call always
transfers control to the same contract, they do not change the values returned
by `get_current_contract` and `get_invoking_contract`. A function call is the
only way to access the private methods of a contract, although it can also
be used to access the public methods of a contract.

To perform a function call, simply make a Rust function call.

### Contract invocation

A contract invocation is a more powerful and more expensive kind of contract
interaction. A contract invocation is similar to starting a new process because
the code that runs will be in a separate address space, meaning that they do
not share any data other than what was passed in the invocation. While a
contract invocation typically transfers control to a _different_ contract, it
is possible to transfer control to the currently running contract. Regardless
of whether the contract that receives control is a different contract or the
currently running contract, the value returned by `get_invoking_contract` will
be the previous value of `get_current_contract`. A contract invocation can only
access the public methods of a contract.

If a contract contains a public function `f`, then invoking `f` can be done by
making a Rust function call to `f::invoke`.

Some contracts, such as the token contract, only export the contract invocation
functions. In doing so, they are able to assign those functions friendly names.
For example,
[initialize](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/42380647bb817bf01c739c19286f18be881e0e41/src/contract.rs#L55-L57)

```rust
#[contractimpl(export_if = "export")]
impl TokenTrait for Token {
    fn initialize(e: Env, admin: Identifier, decimal: u32, name: Binary, symbol: Binary) {
```

is [exported](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/42380647bb817bf01c739c19286f18be881e0e41/src/lib.rs#L26)
as

```rust
pub use crate::contract::initialize::invoke as initialize;
```

This function is then easily [called by the liquidity pool contract](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/blob/4060d3bd5ee7846020b68ee583665a4d4cf4b315/liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs#L164-L171).

### Stellar Operation

A Stellar operation is the ultimate entrypoint of every contract interaction. An
operation transfers control and external data to a contract, allowing execution
to begin.

This kind of interaction is currently supported in experimental versions of
stellar-core only.

## Interacting with contracts in tests

[Debugging contracts](debugging) explains that
it is much more convenient to debug using native code than WASM. Given that you
are testing native code, it is tempting to interact with your contract directly
using function calls. If you attempt this approach, you will find that it
doesn't always work. Function call interactions do not set the environment into
the correct state for contract execution, so functions involving contract data
and determining the current or invoking contract will not work.

When writing tests, it is important to always interact with contracts through
contract invocation. In a production setting, contract invocation will execute
WASM bytecode loaded from the ledger. So how does this work if you are testing
native code? You must register your contract with the environment so it knows
what functions are available and how to call them. While this sounds complex,
the `contractimpl` procedural macro automatically generates almost all of the
code to do this. All you have to do is write a small [stub](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/42380647bb817bf01c739c19286f18be881e0e41/src/testutils.rs#L12-L15)
to actually call the generated code, such as

```rust
pub fn register_test_contract(e: &Env, contract_id: &[u8; 32]) {
    let contract_id = FixedBinary::from_array(e, *contract_id);
    e.register_contract(&contract_id, crate::contract::Token {});
}
```

Some contracts, such as the token contract, also provide a [friendlier interface](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/42380647bb817bf01c739c19286f18be881e0e41/src/testutils.rs#L26-L191)
to facilitate testing. There are many ways these interfaces might make testing
easier, but one common one is to allow automatic message signing by passing a
[ed25519_dalek::Keypair](https://docs.rs/ed25519-dalek/latest/ed25519_dalek/struct.Keypair.html).

Note that everything described in this section is only available if the
`testutils` feature is enabled.

### Example

This machinery can also be used to test multiple contracts together. For
example, the single offer contract test case [creates a token](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/blob/56fef787395b5aed7cd7b19772cca28e21b3feb5/single_offer/src/test.rs#L22).

## Calling contracts

Contracts are invoked through a pair of host functions `call` and `try_call`:

- `try_call(contract, function, args)` calls `function` exported from `contract`, passing `args` and returning a `Status` on any error.
- `call(contract, function, args)` just calls `try_call` with its arguments and traps on `Status`, essentially propagating the error.

In both cases `contract` is a `Binary` host object containing the contract ID, `function` is a `Symbol` holding the name of an exported function to call, and `args` is a `Vector` of values to pass as arguments.

These host functions can be invoked in two separapte ways:

- From outside the host, such as when a user submits a transaction that calls a contract.
- From within the host, when one contract calls another.

Both cases follow the same logic:

- The contract's WASM bytecode is retrieved from a `CONTRACT_DATA` ledger entry in the host's storage system.
- A WASM VM is instantiated for the duration of the invocation.
- The function is looked up and invoked, with arguments passed from caller to callee.

When a call occurs from outside the host, any arguments will typically be provided in serialized XDR form accompanying the transaction, and will be deserialized and converted to host objects automatically before invoking the contract.

When a call occurs from inside the host, the caller and callee contracts _share the same host_ and the caller can pass references to host objects directly to the callee without any need to serialize or deserialize them.

Since host objects are immutable, there is limited risk to passing a shared reference from one contract to another: the callee cannot modify the object in a way that would surprise the caller, only create new objects.

## Storage footprint and preflight

As mentioned in the [persisting data](../learn/persisting-data) section, a contract can only load or store `CONTRACT_DATA` entries that are declared in a _footprint_ associated with its invocation.

A footprint is a set of ledger keys, each marked as either read-only or read-write. Read-only keys are available to the transaction for reading, read-write available for reading, writing or both.

Any transaction submitted by a user has to be accompanied by a footprint. A single footprint encompasses _all_ the data read and written by _all_ contracts transitively invoked by the transaction: not just the initial contract that the transaction calls, but also all contracts it calls, and so on.

Since it can be difficult for a user to always know which ledger entries a given contract call will attempt to read or write -- especially those caused by contracts called by other contracts deep within a transaction -- the host provides an auxiliary **"preflight"** mechanism that executes a transaction against a temporary, possibly slightly-stale _snapshot_ of the ledger. The preflight mechanism is _not_ constrained to only read or write the contents of a footprint; rather it _records_ a footprint describing the transaction's execution, discards the execution's effects, and then returns the recorded footprint it to its caller.

Such a preflight-provided footprint can then be used to accompany a "real" submission of the same transaction to the network for real execution. If the state of the ledger has changed too much between the time of the preflight and the real submission, the footprint may be too stale and no longer accurately identify the _keys_ the transaction needs to read and write, at which point the preflight must be retried to refresh the footprint.

In any event -- whether successful or failing -- the real transaction will execute atomically, deterministically and with serializable consistency semantics. An inaccurate footprint simply causes deterministic transaction failure, not a stale-read anomaly. All effects of such a failed transaction are discarded, as they would be in the presence of any other error.
