# Introduction

We are excited to introduce you to Soroban, a powerful smart contracts platform designed to be sensible, built-to-scale, and developer-friendly, with a focus on Rust's performance and safety benefits. Although Soroban is not specifically tailored for transitioning from Solidity to Rust, it's an excellent option for developers looking to make this shift. In this article, we will explore the fundamentals of Solidity, Rust, and Soroban, and guide you through setting up the development environment to start your journey with Soroban's Rust smart contract compatibility.

## Solidity and dApp Development

Solidity is a high-level, statically-typed programming language primarily used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that can run on various blockchain platforms, automating complex transactions and interactions without the need for a central authority.

## Rust: Performance and Safety

Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety, concurrency, and performance. Its unique features, such as a strong static type system, ownership model, and memory safety guarantees, make it an ideal choice for developing high-performance, secure applications, including smart contracts.

## Introducing Soroban

Soroban, a sensible and built-to-scale smart contracts platform, offers a developer-friendly and batteries-included experience. Although it is compatible with Stellar, a blockchain that aligns with its values of scale and sensibility, Soroban can operate independently and be utilized by any transaction processor, such as other blockchains, L2s, and permissioned ledgers.

You can learn more about Soroban's features and benefits in the [Soroban Welcome Page](../).

## Setting Up the Development Environment for Rust and Soroban

To get started with Rust and Soroban, follow the steps on the [Setup Page](../getting-started/setup).

# Conclusion

As you embark on your journey with Soroban, remember that the platform is designed to provide a seamless, efficient, and enjoyable experience for developers transitioning from Solidity to Rust. By leveraging Rust's performance and safety benefits, alongside Soroban's advanced smart contract features, you'll be well-equipped to develop high-quality, efficient, and secure dApps.
