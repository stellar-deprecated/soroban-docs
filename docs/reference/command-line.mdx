`soroban-cli` allows you to interact with deployed contracts, set different identities to sign with, set different networks, and generate new keys.

# Generate a new idendity

The easiest way to get started is to generate a new identity:

```bash
soroban config identity generate alice
```

This will generate a new seed phrase for the identity `alice`.

```bash
soroban config identity ls
```

Should output

```bash
alice
```

Now this identity can be referenced when using other commands.  For example,

```bash
soroban contract invoke --id 10 --identity alice -- hello ..
```

# The `contract` subcommand

All commands that relate to interactions with a contract are organized under the `contract` subcommand.

```bash
soroban contract --help
```
returns

```bash
soroban-contract 
Tools for smart contract developers

USAGE:
    soroban contract <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help    Print help information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    bindings    Generate code client bindings for a contract
    deploy      Deploy a contract
    inspect     Inspect a WASM file listing contract functions, meta, etc
    install     Install a WASM file to the ledger without creating a contract instance
    invoke      Invoke a contract function
    optimize    Optimize a WASM file
```

# Invoking function with arguments

Since each contract has its xdr definition embedded in the binary, it's possible to dynamically generate a custom CLI for each contract function.

Anything after the `--` is parsed as arguments to the function. And it even includes a help page

```bash
soroban contract invoke --id 10 --identity alice -- --help
```

## Arguments as flags

Each argument to the contract function is parsed as flags. For example,

```bash
soroban contract invoke --id 10 --identity alice -- hello --to world
```

Would pass `world` to the `hello` function.
