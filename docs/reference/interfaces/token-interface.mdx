title: Token Interface
---

Token contracts, including the Stellar Asset Contract and example token
implementations expose the following common interface.

Tokens deployed on Soroban can implement any interface they choose, however,
they should satisfy the following interface to be interoperable with contracts
built to support Soroban's built-in tokens.

Note, that in the specific cases the interface doesn't have to be fully
implemented. For example, the custom token may not implement the administrative
interface compatible with the Stellar Asset Contract - it won't stop it from
being usable in the contracts that only perform the regular user operations
(transfers, allowances, balances etc.).

### Compatibility Requirements

For any given contract function, there are 3 requirements that should be
consistent with the interface described here:

- Function interface (name and arguments) - if not consistent, then the users
simply won't be able to use the function at all. This is the hard requirement.
- Authorization - the users have to authorize the token function calls with all
the arguments of the invocation (see the interface comments). If this is
inconsistent, then the custom token may have issues with getting the correct
signatures from the users and may also confuse the wallet software.
- Events - the token has to emit the events in the specified format. If
inconsistent, then the token may not be handled correctly by the downstream
systems such as block explorers.

### Code

The interface below uses the Rust [soroban-sdk](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/reference/sdks/rust).

```rust

    // --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Admin interface â€“ privileged functions.
    // --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    //
    // All the admin functions have to be authorized by the admin with all input
    // arguments, i.e. they have to call `admin.require_auth()`.

    /// If "admin" is the administrator, clawback "amount" from "from". "amount" is burned.
    /// Emit event with topics = ["clawback", admin: Address, to: Address], data = [amount: i128]
    fn clawback(
        env: soroban_sdk::Env,
        admin: Address,
        from: Address,
        amount: i128,
    );

    /// If "admin" is the administrator, mint "amount" to "to".
    /// Emit event with topics = ["mint", admin: Address, to: Address], data = [amount: i128]
    fn mint(
        env: soroban_sdk::Env,
        admin: Address,
        to: Address,
        amount: i128,
    );

    /// If "admin" is the administrator, set the administrator to "id".
    /// Emit event with topics = ["set_admin", admin: Address], data = [new_admin: Address]
    fn set_admin(
        env: soroban_sdk::Env,
        admin: Address,
        new_admin: Address,
    );

    /// If "admin" is the administrator, set the authorize state of "id" to "authorize".
    /// If "authorize" is true, "id" should be able to use its balance.
    /// Emit event with topics = ["set_auth", admin: Address, id: Address], data = [authorize: bool]
    fn set_auth(
        env: soroban_sdk::Env,
