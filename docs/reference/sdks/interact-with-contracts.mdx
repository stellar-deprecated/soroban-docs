## JavaScript SDK

`stellar-sdk` is the JavaScript library for communicating with a Soroban RPC server, communicating with the Horizon API, and building transactions on the Stellar network. It is used for building Stellar apps either on Node.js or in the browser.

It provides:

- a networking layer API for Soroban RPC methods and the Horizon API.
- facilities for building and signing transactions, for communicating with an RPC instance, for communicating with a Horizon instance, and for submitting transactions or querying network state.

The SDK is available at: https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk and on NPM [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellar/stellar-sdk).

## Python SDK

`py-stellar-base` is a Python library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. It is used for building Stellar apps on Python. It supports Python 3.7+ as well as PyPy 3.7+.

This SDK is maintained by a dedicated community developer.

It provides:

- a networking layer API for Horizon endpoints.
- facilities for building and signing transactions, for communicating with a Stellar Horizon instance, and for submitting transactions or querying network history.

The Python SDK is available at: https://github.com/StellarCN/py-stellar-base

## iOS SDK

The `stellar-ios-mac-sdk` is an open source Stellar SDK for iOS & Mac. It provides APIs to build transactions and connect to Horizon.

It also provides functionality to deploy and invoke Soroban smart contracts and communicates with the Soroban RPC Server.
