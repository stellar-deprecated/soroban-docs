`stellar-sdk` is the JavaScript library for communicating with a Soroban RPC server, communicating with the Horizon API, and building transactions on the Stellar network. It is used for building Stellar apps either on Node.js or in the browser.

It provides:

- a networking layer API for Soroban RPC methods and the Horizon API.
- facilities for building and signing transactions, for communicating with an RPC instance, for communicating with a Horizon instance, and for submitting transactions or querying network state.
