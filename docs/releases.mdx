The following Soroban releases are preview releases.

We’re releasing early versions of Soroban because we believe it’s important to
share the development process, and we want Stellar ecosystem developers and
smart contract developers from other ecosystems to have a chance to experiment
and provide feedback.

:::caution
Preview releases are software releases that are also released to the [Futurenet]
test network. Software releases may occur between Futurenet releases. If you're
interacting with Futurenet the recommended software versions to use in
development are below. Releases to Futurenet may include network resets and
network passphrase changes.
