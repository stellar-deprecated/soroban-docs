title: Soroban Rust Auth SDK
---

The `soroban-auth` Rust crate contains the Soroban Rust Auth SDK. It provides
types and utilities for authenticating participants in a variety of ways
including:
- Authenticating by being the invoker, as an transaction source account or a
contract.
- Presigned invocations with account signers or ed25519 keys, similar to
[EIP-2612] and [EIP-712] in the Ethereum ecosystem.

:::info
If you're just starting to explore Soroban, checkout the [auth example] that
uses a simpler form of invoker auth.
:::

The Auth SDK identifies participants with the `Identifier` type, and
participants choose how they will be authenticated by providing a `Signature`.

An `Identifier` can represent a:
- Account ID
- Contract ID
- Ed25519 key

A `Signature` can be an:
- Invoker — An invoking transaction source account, or an invoking contract.
- Account – An invocation presigned with account signers.
- Ed25519 – An invocation presigned with an ed25519 key.

Intended for use alongside the [`soroban-sdk`].
