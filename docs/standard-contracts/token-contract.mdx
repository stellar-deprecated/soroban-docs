# Standard Token Contract

The token contract is an implementation of [CAP-54 Smart Contract Standardized Asset].

[CAP-54 Smart Contract Standardized Asset]: https://stellar.org/protocol/cap-54

:::caution
The token contract is in early development, has not been audited, and is not
intended for use. Report issues

## Overview

Tokens are a vital part of blockchains, and contracts that implement token
functionality are inevitable on any smart contract platform. A standard token
contract has a number of advantages over token contracts written by the
ecosystem. First, we can special case this contract and run it natively instead
of running in a WASM VM, reducing the cost of using the contract. Second, we
can use this native contract to allow "classic" Stellar assets to interoperate
with Soroban. The current iteration of the standard token contract doesn't run
natively or interoperate with "classic" Stellar assets, but these improvements
will be made in the future. Note that this standard token contract does not
prevent the ecosystem from developing other token contracts if the standard is
missing functionality they require.

The standard token contract is similar to the widely used ERC-20 token standard,
which should make it easier for existing smart contract developers to get
started on Stellar.

## Token contract authorization semantics 

This section describes a specific implementation of the general principles
discussed in [authorization](../learn/authorization.mdx).

### Identities

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub enum Identifier {
    Contract(U256),
    Ed25519(U256),
    Account(U256),
}
```

The token contract understands three kinds of identities: contracts, Ed25519
public keys, and Stellar accounts. For each kind of identity, there is a
corresponding authorization mechanism. 

#### Contract authorization

A contract identity provides
authorization simply by being the invoker of the token contract.

#### Ed25519 public key authorization

An Ed25519 public key identity can provide authorization by signing an
appropriate message with the associated private key. The authorization is
just the 512-bit signature, referred to as a `U512` in the contract.

#### Stellar account authorization

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub struct KeyedEd25519Signature {
    pub public_key: U256,
    pub signature: U512,
}

pub type AccountAuthorization = Vec<KeyedEd25519Signature>;
```

A Stellar account identity can provide authorization by signing an appropripate
message with the private keys associated with the signers of that Stellar
account. The total signing weight of the signers must exceed the medium
threshold of that Stellar account. The authorization is a vector, where each
element of the vector contains a public key used to sign the message and the
corresponding 512-bit signature.

### Token operations

The token contract contains three kinds of operations

- getters, such as `balance`, which do not change the state of the contract
- unprivileged mutators, such as `approve` and `xfer`, which change the state of
the contract but do not require special privileges
- privileged mutators, such as `burn` and `set_admin`, which change the state of
the contract but require special privileges

Gettors require no authorization because they do not change the state of the
contract and all contract data is public. For example, `balance` simply returns
the balance of the specified identity without changing it.

Unprivileged mutators require authorization from some identity. The identity
which must provide authorization will vary depending on the unprivileged
mutator. For example, a "grantor" can use `approve` to allow a "spender" to spend
the grantor's money up to some limit. So for approve, the grantor must provide
authorization. Similarly, a "sender" can use `xfer` to send money to a
"recipient". So for `xfer`, the sender must provide authorization. The
authorization for an unprivileged mutator is a [KeyedAuthorization](#keyedauthorization)
because the identity that is providing the authorization must be specified.

Priviliged mutators require authorization from a specific privileged identity,
known as the "administrator". For example, only the administrator can `mint` more
of the asset. Similarly, only the administrator can appoint a new administrator.
The authorization for a privileged mutator is an [Authorization](#authorization)
because the identity that is providing the authorization is known to be the
administrator.

### Messages

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub struct MessageV0 {
    pub nonce: BigInt,
    pub domain: u32,
    pub parameters: Vec<EnvVal>,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub enum Message {
    V0(MessageV0),
}
```

Those signatures are derived by signing the `Message` enum, which has one value
at the moment, `V0`. `MessageV0` requires the [current nonce](#replay-prevention)
for the identity providing authorization, a
[domain](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/main/src/cryptography.rs),
and the function parameters.

### Replay prevention

Whenever signatures are used to permit an operation, there is a risk of
"replay". Replay occurs when a single signature is used to permit an operation
multiple times. Such a situation can be catastrophic. For example, imagine that
you sign a message permitting 1 dollar to be sent to an acquantaince. If there
were no replay prevention, then a malicious acquantaince could use that message
to repeatedly transfer 1 dollar from you to them. In the end, your bank account
would be empty.

The token contract provides replay prevention by using a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce).
The messages that are signed to provide authorization contain a nonce. The
contract also stores a nonce per identity. When checking signatures, the
contract loads the nonce for the relevant identity. When an operation succeeds,
the nonce stored in the contract is incremented. This makes it impossible to
reuse a signature.

The current nonce for an identity can be retrieved using the nonce contract
function.

### Authorization

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub enum Authorization {
    Contract,
    Ed25519(U512),
    Account(AccountAuthorization),
}
```

Used by `mint`, `burn`, `freeze`, `unfreeze`, and `set_admin`. The content of
the authorization depends on the [identity](#identities) of the administrator.

### KeyedAuthorization

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub struct KeyedEd25519Signature {
    pub public_key: U256,
    pub signature: U512,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub struct KeyedAccountAuthorization {
    pub public_key: U256,
    pub signatures: AccountAuthorization,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub enum KeyedAuthorization {
    Contract,
    Ed25519(KeyedEd25519Signature),
    Account(KeyedAccountAuthorization),
}
```

Used by `allowance`, `approve`, `xfer`, and `xfer_from`. The content of
the authorization depends on the [identity](#identity) of the administrator.
This is similar to an [Authorization](#authorization) but also includes
additional information so the contract knows what identity is providing
authorization.

### Example: Signing messages

The two
[examples](https://github.com/stellar//soroban-token-contract/blob/37e2cd3580f8e28beea9e8f9194b9cf8547472dd/src/testutils.rs#L55)
from the test `Token` wrapper class demonstrate how you sign a contract
function that expects an `Authorization` and a `KeyedAuthorization` type.

#### Authorization
The admin must match the `Identifier` that was used to `initialize` the contract. 
```rust
pub fn mint(&self, admin: &Keypair, to: &Identifier, amount: &BigInt) {
    let mut args: Vec<EnvVal> = Vec::new(&self.env);
    args.push(to.clone().into_env_val(&self.env));
    args.push(amount.clone().into_env_val(&self.env));
    let msg = Message::V0(MessageV0 {
        nonce: self.nonce(&to_ed25519(&self.env, admin)),
        domain: Domain::Mint as u32,
        parameters: args,
    });
    let auth = Authorization::Ed25519(admin.sign(msg).unwrap().into_val(&self.env));
    mint(&self.env, &self.contract_id, &auth, to, amount)
}
```

#### KeyedAuthorization
```rust
 pub fn approve(&self, from: &Keypair, spender: &Identifier, amount: &BigInt) {
    let mut args: Vec<EnvVal> = Vec::new(&self.env);
    args.push(spender.clone().into_env_val(&self.env));
    args.push(amount.clone().into_env_val(&self.env));
    let msg = Message::V0(MessageV0 {
        nonce: self.nonce(&to_ed25519(&self.env, from)),
        domain: Domain::Approve as u32,
        parameters: args,
    });
    let auth = KeyedAuthorization::Ed25519(KeyedEd25519Authorization {
        public_key: from.public.to_bytes().into_val(&self.env),
        signature: from.sign(msg).unwrap().into_val(&self.env),
    });
    approve(&self.env, &self.contract_id, &auth, spender, amount)
}
```

## Contract Interface

```rust
// Admin interface

// Sets the administrator to "admin". Also sets some metadata
fn initialize(e: Env, admin: Identifier, decimal: u32, name: Binary, symbol: Binary);

// If "admin" is the administrator, burn "amount" from "from"
fn burn(e: Env, admin: Authorization, from: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// If "admin" is the administrator, mint "amount" to "to"
fn mint(e: Env, admin: Authorization, to: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// If "admin" is the administrator, set the administrator to "id"
fn set_admin(e: Env, admin: Authorization, new_admin: Identifier);

// If "admin" is the administrator, freeze "id"
fn freeze(e: Env, admin: Authorization, id: Identifier);

// If "admin" is the administrator, unfreeze "id"
fn unfreeze(e: Env, admin: Authorization, id: Identifier);

// Token Interface

// Get the allowance for "spender" to transfer from "from"
fn allowance(e: Env, from: Identifier, spender: Identifier) -> BigInt;

// Set the allowance to "amount" for "spender" to transfer from "from"
fn approve(e: Env, from: KeyedAuthorization, spender: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// Get the balance of "id"
fn balance(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> BigInt;

// Transfer "amount" from "from" to "to"
fn xfer(e: Env, from: KeyedAuthorization, to: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// Transfer "amount" from "from" to "to", consuming the allowance of "spender"
fn xfer_from(e: Env, spender: KeyedAuthorization, from: Identifier, to: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// Returns true if "id" is frozen
fn is_frozen(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> bool;

// Returns the current nonce for "id"
fn nonce(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> BigInt;

// Descriptive Interface

// Get the number of decimals used to represent amounts of this token
fn decimals(e: Env) -> u32;

// Get the name for this token
fn name(e: Env) -> Binary;

// Get the symbol for this token
fn symbol(e: Env) -> Binary;
```

## Interacting with the token contract in tests

See [interacting with contracts in tests](../learn/interacting-with-contracts#interacting-with-contracts-in-tests)
for more general information on this topic.

This [test
case](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/37e2cd3580f8e28beea9e8f9194b9cf8547472dd/tests/test.rs#L20)
shows how the token contract can be used easily in tests. Note that the actual call into the
contract is in the
[Token](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/37e2cd3580f8e28beea9e8f9194b9cf8547472dd/src/testutils.rs#L26)
wrapper test class.
