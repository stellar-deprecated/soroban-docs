title: Run on a Local Network
---

If you have Docker installed, you can run a local network with the Stellar
Quickstart Docker image.

The Quickstart image is a single container that runs everything you need to test
against a fully featured network. It contains a Stellar node, Soroban RPC
server, Horizon server, and Friendbot server.

If you have the [`soroban-cli`] installed, you can deploy contracts to a network
and invoke those functions from the command line.

The Soroban sandbox environment is the same Soroban environment that runs on
Stellar networks, but it runs without nodes, and without the other features you
find on a Stellar network.

:::info
It's also possible to run the contract on a fully featured local network.  See
[Run on a Local Network] for more details.
:::

Using the code we wrote in [Write a Contract] and the resulting `.wasm` file
we built in [Build] run the following command to invoke the `hello`
function with a single argument `friend`.

```sh
soroban invoke \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_project.wasm \
    --id 1 \
    --fn hello \
    --arg friend
```

The following output should appear.

```json
["Hello","friend"]
```

[Write a Contract]: write-a-contract
[Run on a Local Network]: run-on-local-network
[Build]: build
[`soroban-cli`]: ../getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli
