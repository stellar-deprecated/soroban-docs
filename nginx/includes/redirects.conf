# Nothing has been done here yet, but I'm noting what changes will need to be addressed
# [x] "fundamentals-and-concepts" is now "soroban-internals"
# [x] all of the "basic-tutorials" are now in "tutorials"
# [x] all of the "advanced-tutorials" are now in "tutorials"
# [x] The new way of listing tutorials now replaces "/docs/category/tutorials" with "/docs/tutorials"
# [x] "reference/interfaces/token-interface" has moved to "tokens/token-interface" (this'll be a big one!)
# [x] "tutorials/stellar-asset-contract" has moved to "tokens/stellar-asset-contract"
# [x] "soroban-internals/migrate-from-evm" has moved to "migrate/evm"
# [x] "releases" has moved up one level ("/docs/{reference,resources}/releases" -> "/docs/releases")
# [x] "faq" has moved up one level ("/docs/{reference,resources}/faq" -> "/docs/faq")
# [x] "resources/testnet" has been moved to "resources/networks"
# [x] various SDK pages have been collapsed into "resources/sdks/{write-contracts,interact-with-contracts}"
# [x] "soroban-internals/{built-in-types,custom-types,fully-typed-contracts}" have been moved into an umbrella "soroban-internals/types" directory
# [x] "soroban-internals/invoking-contracts-with-transactions.mdx" has moved to "soroban-internals/contract-interactions/stellar-transactions.mdx"
# [x] other misc shuffling of content and pages into "soroban-internals/contract-interactions/"
# [x] "soroban-internals/interacting-with-contracts.mdx" moved to "soroban-internals/contract-interactions/index.mdx"
