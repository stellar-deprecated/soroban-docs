It should also be used by backend Dapp components to \"ingest\" events into their own database for querying and serving.\n\nIf making multiple requests, clients should deduplicate any events received, based on the event's unique id field.

Events are emitted here: [rs-soroban-env/event.rs @ `924d86c`](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/blob/924d86cacd58b8a162344bfe0ab37d9668f5d629/soroban-env-host/src/native_contract/token/event.rs#L21-L33). I've decoded the base64-encoded ScVals for easier reading (both the symbols and addresses). In real usage, the `ScSymbol(\"transfer\").toXdr().toString(\"base64\")`, and `ScBinary(pubkeyBytes).toXdr().toString(\"base64\")`, would be base64 encoded strings for exact matches. For example:\n\n    - `[ScSymbol(\"transfer\"), \"*\", \"*\"]`\n\n        - Matches any token transfer events\n\n    - `[ScSymbol(\"transfer\"), \"*\", \"GABC...123\"]`\n\n        - Matches any token transfer events to recipient: GABC...123\n\n    - `[ScSymbol(\"transfer\"), \"GDEF...456\", \"GABC...123\"]`\n\n        - Matches only token transfers from GDEF...456 to GABC...123.",
